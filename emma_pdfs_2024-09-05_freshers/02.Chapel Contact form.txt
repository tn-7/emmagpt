Emmanuel College Chapel

Name……………………………………………………………………………………………….

The Christian community in College is very diverse with people going to many different

churches and belonging to many different religious societies. This diversity is encouraging

but it can be difficult to keep track of everything that is going on! Without wishing to

compromise the beliefs of any church or group, the Chapel acts as a focus for all this

activity, offering regular worship at the heart of the College.

We use the Chapel email to keep in touch and we try to involve people from as wide a

variety of backgrounds as possible in things like reading from time to time at the main

services.

If you are at all interested in asking questions about faith, or if you are already a practising

Christian, please sign up for the Chapel email list and we will contact you at the beginning

of term.

  I  would like to be kept informed of Chapel events via the Chapel email (we    will use

      your @cam address, which you will be given when you arrive).

  I  would be willing to help with reading in Chapel (we will give you coaching  and an

      opportunity to practise if you would like).

If you would like any help in getting in touch with a church or religious group of any kind in

Cambridge, please indicate here
