Foreword by the Postgraduate Tutor

This Induction Programme will welcome you to Emma and aims to

make you feel at home as quickly as possible. As you will gather, there

are many people here who are happy to help you if anything is unclear

or if you have diﬃculties. If you have a question or a problem, then do

ask!

We do our best to put you at your ease in your ﬁrst few days as a

postgraduate student, but please remember that your course will start

quite quickly and will start making demands on you almost

immediately. It is important not to be taken by surprise by this and to

get into appropriate habits of work right from the start. Don’t be

surprised, either, if the pattern of your work as a postgraduate student

is diﬀerent from what you have been familiar with in the past.

I wish you well with your course and hope you have a fulﬁlling time

here both academically and socially!

Some of the activities in the programme are compulsory or highly

advisable – they are shaded in pink. Other activities are more
