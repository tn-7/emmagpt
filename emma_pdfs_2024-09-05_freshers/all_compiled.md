Dear Postgraduate Student,

Many congratulations on your new academic journey!

I am pleased to welcome you at Emmanuel College, an inclusive, vibrant and

friendly community. Thank you for choosing Emmanuel College, a place where we

aim to equip every member with the knowledge and skills they need to ﬂourish, for

life. I hope that your journey with us is enjoyable, and I very much look forward to

meeting you in person before too long.

TO ALL NEW POSTGRADUATE STUDENTS

This letter sets out the arrangements for paying the bills that cover your fees and

other charges such as food and rent. Please read it carefully, and if you have any

queries regarding this letter or ﬁnancial matters in general, please do not hesitate     to

contact me.

BEFORE YOU COME TO CAMBRIDGE

Postgraduates will be required to make a ‘First Payment’ at the start of their studies,

details below.

You must complete and return the form ‘Details of Funding for University

Composition Fees’ to student-billing@emma.cam.ac.uk. This tells us who to bill for

the University Composition Fees for your course. This may be your department, a

funding body or you personally. All Postgraduates should return this form by 1st

September.

Postgraduates who expect their University Composition Fees to be paid by a UK

grant making body, for example a Research Council, the Wellcome Trust, University

Department etc., must provide the postgraduate admissions team with a copy of the

formal award letter from the grant making body, or their Department in Cambridge,

notifying them of the award. Please send this to postgrad-

admissions@emma.cam.ac.uk by 1st September.

All postgraduates are required to obtain a guarantor to sign a legally binding

contract accepting responsibility for the payment of their University Composition

Fees. The guarantor may be the student themselves, a parent or the funding body

named on the Details of Funding for University Composition Fees form mentioned

above. The Postgraduate Form of Guarantee is enclosed with this letter. The

guarantee must be sent to student-billing@emma.cam.ac.uk together with the

Funding for University Composition Fees form, by no later than 1st September.

FIRST PAYMENT AND COLLEGE BILLS

For European and Overseas students, we strongly recommend you obtain your visa

before making the First Payment, as without a visa you will not be able to enter the

UK.

All postgraduates are required to make a First Payment. This is £2,740.00 if you are

living in college accommodation, or £548.00 if you are living in privately owned

accommodation or in a couple`s ﬂat. This amount is then held as a permanent credit

on your account and is set against the ﬁnal bill for your course. A First Payment is

required because rent and charges are billed a signiﬁcant time in arrears (termly)

and if your expenditure follows a normal pattern then your ﬁnal bill should be close

to zero. If you arrive in October your ﬁrst bill for rent and other charges will not be

due for payment until January, but if you arrive before October 1st an initial bill will

be issued – see below. The First Payment does not oﬀset against any interim debts to

the College.

For Postgraduates receiving scholarships from Emmanuel College, your First

payment will be retained from the scholarship. If for any reason you are unable to

make the First Payment in time or will experience hardship as a result of making

your First Payment, please contact me as soon as possible.

Until your First Payment has been paid you will not be able to collect your room key.

The Porter’s Lodge will be able to check that your payment has cleared. If you arrive

at the Porter’s Lodge without either having paid the First payment or being granted

a special permission by the Bursar, you will need to pay the First Payment by credit

card to the Porters.

Postgraduates who decide to move out of College accommodation may have 80% of

their First Payment returned as a credit against their College bill. Conversely, those

students who have paid the reduced First Payment will be required to pay the

balance if they take up College accommodation.

PAYMENT OF TERMLY BILLS

Please note, if you take up residence in your room before 1st of October, you will be

charged for rent from the arrival date to 30th September. Payment for this will be

due by mid-October.

The dates by which Termly bills must be paid during the academic year 2024-25 are

as follows:

     Michaelmas Term     by 15th January 2025

     Lent Term           by 27th April 2025

     Easter Term         by 20th August 2025

     Long Vacation       by 15th October 2025

                      St Andrew’s Street, Cambridge CB2 3AP

                      www.emma.cam.ac.uk  @emmanuelcambridge
Your bills will be sent to you by e-mail from student-billing@emma.cam.ac.uk. If you

have any queries about your bill, please get in touch via the same email.

Reminders will not be sent, and if you do not pay your bill on time, you will be

subject to a £50 College Fine.

Please note that the First Payment cannot be oﬀset against any interim debts to the

College.

Postgraduates who are unable to pay their bill on time should immediately contact

the Postgraduate Tutor who will, in appropriate cases, make special arrangements

on account of hardship. Please see below the list of tutors assigned on surname basis:

A to H         Mr. Jeremy Caddick

I to P         Professor Clare Pettitt

R to Z         Professor Cathie Rae

During your ﬁnal year, special procedures will apply.

Postgraduates with a course end date of September, your Easter Term bill will be

due 7 days before your intended departure date. If your dissertation is overrunning

for any reason, the Easter Term bill will be due by the second Wednesday in October.

Postgraduates with a course date end of June, please be advised that credit facilities

for rent will no longer apply after 30th June in your ﬁnal year, and rent will be

charged monthly in advance for July, August and September. Invoices will be raised

on the ﬁrst of each of these months and if not paid within 7 days you will be

required to vacate your college accommodation.

A ﬁnal bill for any other (non-rent) long vacation charges will be sent to you at the

end of September and will be due for payment with the Easter Term bill. If you leave

before the end of September, you must pay these additional charges along with your

Easter Term bill before you leave.

If your course end date over-runs, and you remain in college accommodation, you

will be billed monthly in advance for your rent until you vacate college

accommodation. Other personal charges will continue to be billed to you on a

termly basis.

Postgraduates are required to inform the College of their impending departure no

later than two weeks before your planned leaving date by using the Online Exeat

system available on the College website.

Postgraduates are also required to leave a forwarding address by updating their

First Destination and/or Home address on CamSIS so they remain contactable.

Overseas Postgraduates and those Postgraduates responsible for payment of their

own University Composition Fees, either from a grant paid directly to them or on a

               St Andrew’s Street, Cambridge CB2 3AP

               www.emma.cam.ac.uk         @emmanuelcambridge
personal basis, will be required to pay the fees to the College by no later than the

following dates:

Michaelmas Term        16th October 2024

Lent Term              15th January 2025

Easter Term            27th April 2025

If your course starts at the beginning of October, you will receive a pro forma bill on

arrival at the College and will be required to pay the ﬁrst fee instalment by 16th

October 2024.

A formal fees bill for all University fees due from you in three instalments will be

also sent to you mid-November, which should be identical to the proforma bill

received at the beginning of Michaelmas term. Please adjust the formal bill by

deducting the one third of fees you have already paid and pay half of the balance        of

the invoiced fees by the above due dates. For further clariﬁcation please see

Appendix 1.

If your normal residence is overseas, in your ﬁrst term it may be possible to defer

payment of your fees to allow time for you to open a UK bank account. Payment

may only be delayed until two weeks after the beginning of full term, details about

University term dates can be found on their website: https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-

the-university/term-dates-and-calendars

If you are in ﬁnancial diﬃculty, you should speak to your Postgraduate Tutor at the

earliest opportunity.

PAYMENTS TO STUDENTS AND BANK ACCOUNT REQUIREMENTS

During your time at Emmanuel, it is likely that the College will make a payment to

you, perhaps for a Prize, Award, or Scholarship, or a grant for travel or hardship.

Please be advised that the College will only remit to your personal UK bank account.

Please use the online bank form on the College`s website to request a bank letter that

will enable you to open a UK bank account if you don’t have one. Any unclaimed

balances within 24 months of your course ﬁnishing will be treated as a donation to

the College.

If you do not have a UK bank account, you should be aware that in order to obtain

one it will be necessary to supply various proofs of identity (for example your

current valid passport with visa, letter of introduction from the College - by

contacting Tutorial Oﬃce at tutorial-oﬃce@emma.cam.ac.uk list of College fees,

conﬁrmation of sponsorship or bursary and University card).

                       www.emma.cam.ac.uk  @emmanuelcambridge
In addition, you will need to explain the reason for your residence in the UK.  If you

are in any doubt about your ability to pay via the banking system, travellers’

cheques are an alternative method of payment.

FINANCIAL TRANSFERS FROM HOME AND OVERSEAS BANKS TO THE COLLEGE

All payments for student accounts should be made using the below bank account

details. Transfers may be made from home and overseas banks directly into the

College bank account as detailed below:

                     INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AT EMMANUEL COLLEGE

                     Student Facilities

                     Emmanuel has an excellent computer network that connects more than a

thousand devices, used by Fellows, students and staff, to the University Network and

Internet. All student rooms have wired access to the College computer network and most of the

site is covered by wireless.

Students have access to three managed computer rooms in College; particularly useful for those

without their own computer and for those needing access to specific teaching applications.

•  Robert Sansom Computer Room provides 5 PCs and a Multi-function device that scans,

   prints (both B&W and colour) and photocopies.

•  Emmanuel House Computer Room has 4 PCs and B&W laser printer.

•  Library Computer Room has 5 PCs and a B&W laser printer.

During term all of the rooms are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and require a registered

University card to gain access (which is given to you when you arrive).

Please note that if you decide to bring your own printer, you will have to turn off its wireless

capability and use a USB cable instead to print from your machine. Enabling the wireless on your

printer can cause interference with the College’s wireless network and an intermittent connection

for you and your neighbours.

Connecting your Computer

You should be able to connect any computer running an up-to-date operating system to the

network. This includes Windows 10/11 and Apple MacOS. If you are unsure then please get in

touch using the contact details below. Further details can be found at

www.emma.cam.ac.uk/contact/students/is/connect/ . If you are unable to access this page then

contact us at the start of term; we will be holding an introductory talk during your first week.

If you have any questions then please e-mail is@emma.cam.ac.uk.

See you in October!

                 To New Postgraduate Students

                 Welcome to Emmanuel. I know that when you come up you will find the College

                 to be friendly and welcoming. In each of the Colleges in Cambridge there is a

                 Dean or a Chaplain, most of whom, like me, are clergy of the Church of England.

                 As Dean it is my job to offer support and encouragement to all members of the

College, regardless of whether you have any religious belief or not. I am very aware that life as a

postgraduate student can be stressful and the move from the more structured life of an

undergraduate can pose problems. I am one of the people who are here to help in whatever way I

can. I am in College each day except Saturday. I live in Camden House at the end of Park

Terrace. In a crisis you may contact me at any time. I will be introduced to you soon after you

arrive and I will be around for many of the events in the first few days of term. As well as being the

Dean I am also one of the Postgraduate Tutors, and also the Praelector (the person who looks

after graduation and matriculation ceremonies).

There are, of course, many people in the College who are here to help you. As well as the

Postgraduate Tutors there is a College Counsellor, Tim Ellis, who is available at regular times each

week. There is also a College Nurse to help you with medical matters.

As you might expect, I also run the College Chapel. You can’t miss the Chapel – it faces you as

you come through the front gate and acts as a reminder that there is a religious dimension to all of

life. A community such as Emmanuel includes all shades of religious belief and unbelief, and I

hope that you will find in the Chapel programme something to help you reflect on issues of faith

whatever your background, and whether you regard yourself as an interested bystander or a

committed believer. Everyone is welcome at all the chapel services. In normal times there are

three main services each week, on Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday evenings, as well as

morning prayer on weekdays. Please email me or fill in the accompanying form if you would

like to be kept informed of Chapel events or if you would be willing to help with reading in

Chapel. It is really useful to have as many people as possible to help with the reading. If you are a

singer, the Chapel Choir is a sociable and welcoming group. They will be holding auditions soon

after the beginning of term, and there are Choral Exhibitions and help with singing lessons

available to regular members. Email Graham Walker (ghw22@cam.ac.uk) the Director of Music, to

find out more.

There are many other religious groups that are independent of the Chapel. Within the College the

Christian Union rep is Sophia Brehm (sjb357@cam.ac.uk). There are also many religious

societies and chaplaincies in Cambridge. The Roman Catholic chaplaincy to the University is

based at Fisher House in the centre of town (the College rep is Susie de Vial (sd937@cam.ac.uk)

and the Methodist Chaplaincy is based at Wesley Church. There are Jewish, Muslim and Hindu

chaplaincies and active Buddhist, Sikh Jain and Baha’i societies in the University.

I very much hope that your time here will be happy and fulfilled. I look forward to meeting you!

With very best wishes,

The Reverend Jeremy Caddick

               MATRICULATION FOR POSTGRADUATE STUDENTS

Matriculation is the formal process of enrolling in the University of Cambridge and specifically in

Emmanuel College. You matriculate by signing the Matriculation Book. Before this ceremony

there will be a group photograph, and afterwards an individual photograph. There are several

online declarations that you need to make before the ceremony as well. It is followed by the

formal Matriculation Dinner to celebrate joining the College and University.

If you:

- have matriculated before at Emmanuel then you do not need to attend the ceremony. You are

welcome to come for the photograph at 4.45pm if you would like, and, if this is your first course

as a graduate, you are invited to the dinner later on,

- have matriculated before at a different College in Cambridge University then you will need to

attend the ceremony to matriculate as a member of Emmanuel.

The College Matriculation Ceremony for Postgraduates will take place during the late

afternoon of Wednesday 23 October 2024. This is your top priority on that day and it is not

expected that you will be absent.

If you genuinely have a serious reason why you cannot be present then please contact the

Tutorial Office (tutorial-office@emma.cam.ac.uk) without delay.

WHAT TO WEAR

Either:        Gown and a plain dark dress or suit with skirt or trousers with a white blouse and

               black shoes

Or:            Gown and a plain dark suit with a white shirt, tie and black shoes

NB:      Graduate students with a Cambridge degree wear the gown of the highest Cambridge

         degree you have , e.g. BA, MSci, MEng

         Graduate students from elsewhere wear the BA status gown (the same as a

         Cambridge BA gown but without strings) or, if you are aged 24 or more, the MA status

         gown (also without strings).

If you do not already possess one then you will need to obtain a gown as soon as you arrive. The

MCR Committee or the Porters will be able to help with this.

WHAT HAPPENS

Before the ceremony

Shortly after your arrival you will be sent two links. Please follow both of them and indicate your

agreement before the matriculation ceremony.

The first is to the University Matriculation Form, where you will agree to the following

declarations:

                            St Andrew’s Street, Cambridge CB2 3AP

                                       www.emma.cam.ac.uk

            ‘I promise to observe the Statutes and Ordinances of the University as far

            as they concern me, and to pay due respect and obedience to the

            Chancellor and other officers of the University.’

            ‘I understand that in becoming a member of the above College I accept the

            responsibility of membership of the College and University community and

agree to abide by the statutes, rules and regulations of these institutions and to do nothing

that is harmful to the work or reputation of either of them.’

You will also be giving consent to the processing by the College and the University of your

personal data for proper purposes (as described in the Data Protection Statement on the College

website www.emma.cam.ac.uk/about/documents/). and promising to observe the provisions

of the Data Protection legislation yourself.

The second link concerns the College Regulations and the College Health & Safety guide and

policy . You will find a copy of both of these in your Freshers’ Pack. Please do read them. When

you follow the link you will be asked to indicate that you agree to abide by them.

ON THE DAY OF THE CEREMONY

Please come to the Old Library correctly dressed and with a gown at 4.45pm promptly.

After the procedure has been explained to you, a group photograph will be taken in Front Court.

After that you are asked to come to the Matriculation Ceremony in groups through the afternoon

wearing your gown and dark clothes. There will be a list showing your individual time on the

noticeboard in the B staircase entrance and in the Old Library.

Then you will write your full name in the College Matriculation Book (in your normal handwriting

i.e. not your signature) and the place of your birth. If you were born in the British Isles, you write

the historic county of your birth (i.e. not necessarily the current local government area). By

tradition, the form of county name for such counties as Yorkshire, Cheshire, Lancashire and so

on is York (as in ‘the County of York’), Chester, Lancaster, etc. If you were born outside the British

Isles you write the area (state, province, department, land etc. and the country (e.g. Gironde,

France; Florida, USA; Shandong Province, China)

Immediately afterwards an individual photograph will be taken.

MATRICULATION DINNER

The Matriculation Dinner will be held on the evening of the same day, Wednesday 23 October.

At 7.00 pm there will be drinks in the Old Library followed at 7.30 pm by Dinner in Hall. Dress is as

for the Matriculation ceremony. Everyone wears a gown.

Please complete this form by Wednesday 25 September 2024, if you have any dietary

requirements or food allergies that you wish to be brought to the attention of the College

Catering Department or if you do NOT propose to come to the Freshers’ Dinner and/or the

Matriculation Dinner – please tick the appropriate box. There is no need to complete this form if

you do not have any dietary requirements.

Thank you.

                                                            Postgraduate Tutor

                        Dear New Postgraduate Student,

Welcome to Cambridge, and to Emmanuel College in particular. The aim of this New

Postgraduates’ Pack is to convey the information that you will need to know about arriving

and to give some information about the College and the community here. Some of you will

have studied here for your undergraduate degree and will be familiar with Emmanuel and the

way things happen here. If so, please still read the information here so that you are not

tripped up by things that are different for postgraduates.

There are three Postgraduate Tutors, myself (jlc24@cam.ac.uk), Professor Clare Pettitt

(cp240@cam.ac.uk) and Professor Cathie Rae (cr18@cam.ac.uk) . Between us we have

responsibility for the arrangements for postgraduate students, and for promoting your

general well being. We can liaise with your department or point you in the direction of more

specialized sources of help such as counseling services. If you are not already a member of

Emmanuel, then we look forward to welcoming you here very soon. I am also the Dean and

Chaplain and you will find a letter from me in that capacity among the documents listed on

the website.

You will have received by now a letter from the Board of Graduate Studies (or for a few

students, some other relevant body) saying that you have been admitted as a postgraduate

student from a given date; this may have been accompanied by a statement of conditions

that remain to be fulfilled, and in this case the same conditions apply, of course, to

admission to the College. It is important that you tell us as soon as possible if you are not

intending to take up your place in Cambridge.

This letter refers to a number of documents on the section of the College website for new

postgraduate  students  at     www.emma.cam.ac.uk/admissions/graduates/freshers/.

Freshers’ could get a hard copy of Freshers’ Pack from the Porters’ Lodge on arrival if

needed.

PLANNING YOUR DATE OF ARRIVAL

Michaelmas Term starts on the Tuesday 8th October 2024.

The University Faculty or Department that you are joining will be in touch to explain what

induction arrangements they are making. Should you be unable to arrive on time for whatever

reason please contact both me and your supervisor/course director in your faculty.

For most new postgraduates the College will be providing accommodation. Your room will

be available from 3rd October. If, for any reason, you wish to come earlier than this (for

example if your course requires you to be here earlier), then please let me know in good time

and we will do our best to make appropriate arrangements.

                   FIRST PAYMENT

                   The College requires a First Payment before arrival, which is intended

                   to be equivalent to a typical termly bill for food and accommodation.

                   You are charged in arrears for these things and so the First Payment is

                   a way of spreading the cost of the payments and ensuring that your

last bill, which has the First Payment set against it, is very small. It is not a deposit.

The amount required depends on whether you will be accommodated by College or not and

is detailed in the Bursar’s Financial Letter. Please read both of these documents carefully.

If you will have difficulty making this payment before you arrive (for example, if you need to

wait until your first funding payment)

Please contact us to make other arrangements. Part-time students, those from Harvard and

those in college flats pay a reduced first payment as students in non-college

accommodation.

FINANCIAL GUARANTEE

On the website you will find a financial Guarantee Funding form. It is very important that

everyone completes this form and returns it, so that the College knows where to send the

bills for your fees. If you don’t return the form then the Bursary staff will assume that you are

personally liable for your fees.

ARRIVAL

When you arrive you should check in at the Porters’ Lodge. There you should sign in and

collect your keys and University Card. It is important that we have a signature to confirm

your arrival date. This applies to all students whether you have College accommodation or

not. You must have made your First Payment (or made an arrangement) before the Porters

can give you your key or University Card.

ID AND VISA CHECK

This is compulsory for all students starting a new degree. It takes place on Thursday 3rd,

Friday 4th and Wednesday 9th October between 8.30am and 5pm in the Tutorial Office.

UK students: UK passport (if you do not have a passport, provide your full birth certificate,      a

photo driving licence; or a certificate of naturalisation)

International students: valid passport and documentation confirming immigration

permission.

INDUCTION

Your Tutor will be in touch to arrange the time to meet you. The MCR (see below) will contact

you to welcome you to Emma.

COLLEGE MATRICULATION

There is a separate letter explaining the format for the College Matriculation, which will take

place on Wednesday 23 October. Please put this date in your diary and make sure you are

free from 4.45 pm onwards. For Executive MBA students, there are different arrangements in

place and we will be in contact separately with this information.

                     St Andrew’s Street, Cambridge CB2 3AP

                                  www.emma.cam.ac.uk
                                3

                 ACCOMMODATION

                 If you are being accommodated by the College, then we will let you

                 know which room you have been assigned in a separate email. The

                 rents for College rooms of different grades and the Contribution to

                 Fixed Costs (CFC) are given in the rents document on the website.

The number of weeks’ payable for your rent depends on the category of your course.

If you have been assigned a College room but no longer want it, please let us know

immediately.

We review accommodation regularly and do our best to maintain high standards of

decoration and furnishing. There is further information in the Domestic Matters booklet and

the College Regulations, both of which you can find on the website in the section for new

postgraduate students, at www.emma.cam.ac.uk/teaching/freshers/grads/.

In particular there are two points that are worth emphasising

•  Please do not use sellotape (scotch-tape), blue-tac or other adhesive materials

   likely to damage the rooms.

•  Please note that you should not bring additional furniture of your own into the

   rooms or remove the furniture that is provided. This applies particularly to beds.

   If you have a medical need for a different sort of bed, then you should contact the

   Housekeeper.

The College provides pillows and duvets but not duvet covers, sheets or pillowcases, which

you need to provide yourself. Alternatively, order your college bedding package (a charge of

£15 will be added to your College account) – this includes a single sheet, single duvet cover

and pillowcase. If you wish for these items to be provided by College, prior to your arrival or

once you have moved into your room, please follow the link to the college website. Click on

Add New Request, fill in the details required, chose Household as Job type and lastly click on

Add Job on the left hand side corner of the tab. www.emma.cam.ac.uk/apps/helpdesk/

You must also provide any cutlery and crockery for use in your own room. All postgraduate

houses have communal kitchen areas but these are not intended for large-scale or elaborate

cooking and cooking implements are not provided. Please note that in order to facilitate good

relations between occupants it is essential that communal kitchen areas are kept clean.

Please also bear in mind what it is fair and reasonable to expect from cleaning staff.

In legal terms, you occupy your room under a licence from the College (i.e.not a tenancy). You

must allow anyone else to occupy your room when you are not in residence, and you must

abide by the College Regulations governing guests. In particular guests must be registered via

the online form if they stay in your room for more than one night. There are limits also on the

number of nights that guests may stay. There are College guestrooms that you may book for

your guests by emailing guestrooms@emma.cam.ac.uk.

ABSENCE FROM COLLEGE

If ever you are away from Cambridge for more than a day or two, please leave an address at

which you can be contacted with either the Porters or the Tutorial and Admissions

                 St Andrew’s Street, Cambridge CB2 3AP

                      www.emma.cam.ac.uk
                                                     4

        Administrator in the Tutorial Office. If you don’t do this, we can’t be

        responsible for unsuccessful attempts to communicate with you. It is

        also courteous to let the Porters know when you will be absent so that

        they can deal with enquiries from visitors and friends more easily and

        know how to proceed in an emergency.

POSTGRADUATE TUTORS

The College is responsible for the general welfare of postgraduate students, including

problems with accommodation, etc. One function of the Postgraduate Tutors is to look after

these matters, and it is important that you should feel free to approach us at any time on any

matter that is of concern to you.

I will be Tutor to all postgraduates with surnames beginning A-H, Clare Pettitt to those with

surnames beginning I-P and Cathie Rae will be Tutor to those with surnames beginning R-Z.

We would like to see all the new postgraduate students for whom we will be responsible

soon after the beginning of term, as mentioned above. You can contact us by email at any

time.

The Tutorial Office can deal with many straightforward enquiries, e.g. provision of application

forms or letters confirming status.

YOUR FACULTY OR DEPARTMENT

For most postgraduate students it is the University, rather than the College, that provides

teaching and facilities for research in the way of laboratories and libraries. The pattern of

your relationship with your supervisor (if you have one) and those who teach you will vary

between courses, but it is important to establish a good working relationship with people in

your department at an early stage and, if you are unhappy with the way your studies are

going, that you raise it earlier rather than later.

The College can often intervene to help this relationship work smoothly. Tutors are aware of

the difficulties experienced by postgraduates, and are most willing to talk to you if you are

experiencing problems in getting started, or indeed at any other time.

MCR

The MCR (short for Middle Combination Room) is both a physical room (in Furness Lodge)

and the community of postgraduate students at Emmanuel. The room has newspapers,

computers, a television, tea and coffee-making facilities, a pool table and some games

available for use. The MCR Committee is an elected postgraduate student body, which, as

well as running the MCR, also organises postgraduate activities within the College and

represents the views of postgraduates to the major College Committees. Postgraduates and

their families are an important part of the College community and we hope that you will

yourself play a full part in the general well-being of the community and make full use of all

the facilities that the College offers.

DINING

Inevitably, eating and drinking provide many of the opportunities for social interaction. The

College kitchens are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner throughout the year except for a

        St Andrew’s Street, Cambridge CB2 3AP

                                         www.emma.cam.ac.uk
                                   5

              two-week period over Christmas/New Year, and over Easter and a

              three-week period in August. We hope that postgraduates will wish to

              dine regularly in Hall. At Formal Hall (7.30 pm) members of the College

              are required to wear gowns. A cafeteria system is also operated (5.45-

              7.00 pm). There are also several MCR postgraduate dinners each term

which are most enjoyable and where you can get to know your fellow students and also a

number of dinners throughout the year when you will have an opportunity to meet Fellows of

the College.

INTERNET AND COMMUNICATIONS

All postgraduate rooms have internet connections and a charge for this is included in room

rents. In most cases this is via a wireless network within the house. If you have difficulty in

connecting, or if you require specialised facilities, then the staff of the College Computer

Office can offer help and advice.

In mid August you will be contacted with your University email address (ending @cam.ac.uk)

and instructions for setting up your Raven password, which will give you access to the

password protected parts of the College and University websites. The @cam.ac.uk address

will be used in College and University communications with you and so it is important that

you check it regularly, or make appropriate forwarding arrangements.

The more traditional sort of mail can be addressed to you at ‘Emmanuel College, St Andrew’s

Street, Cambridge, CB2 3AP’ and any letter will be put in your pigeon-hole (in the post room).

Parcels and luggage will be kept for you in the Porters’ Lodge. Internal post within the College

is also delivered to the pigeon-holes, and it is important that you clear your pigeon-hole

regularly.

BICYCLES AND MOTOR CARS

Cambridge is a very crowded city. There are lots of bicycles, so these have to be numbered to

keep track of them. You also need to have a special reason to keep a car in Cambridge.

Bicycles may be kept in the College bicycle sheds, and must be numbered to comply with

University Regulations. Your bicycle number and a marking kit are available from the Porters’

Lodge.

No student in the University may keep, hire or use any motor vehicle, other than a moped,

without obtaining permission from both the College and the University. The College will

normally only grant permission to keep a car in Cambridge if you have a good reason for doing

so. All cars must have an allocated parking space off

the street. To apply to rent one of the College’s parking spaces, write to the Senior Tutor by

early September saying why you need to keep a car. The number of available parking places is

limited.

              St Andrew’s Street, Cambridge CB2 3AP

        INSURANCE

        The College has taken out a college-wide insurance policy that covers

        students’ personal belongings. For more details see the Domestic

        Matters document.

COLLEGE REGULATIONS

Postgraduates are expected to conform to the normal rules of the College. A copy of College

Regulations is included on the website. The term ‘Junior Members’ refers to all students of

the College both postgraduate and undergraduate. Some of the regulations apply to

undergraduates only and I hope these will be obvious. In particular, any regulation that refers

to the Normal Period of Residence (NPR) does not apply to the majority of postgraduate

students who are not restricted to NPR.

CAMSIS

The Cambridge Student Information System (CamSIS) stores student’s record from

application to graduation. Used by staff, students and alumni to manage and extract student

data. It is very important to keep information up to date such as email address, mobile

number, term time and home address. College uses your preferred email to contact you –

you can always change your preferred email. Please notify tutorial-office@emma.cam.ac.uk

asap if you changed anything. If you don’t have and don’t want to have UK mobile number,

please add NO UK NUMBER to your phones on Camsis. Detailed information you can find

here:   www.cambridgestudents.cam.ac.uk/new-students/manage-your-student-

information/student-record/camsis/what-camsis-can-do-you

We very much look forward to welcoming you to Emmanuel.

Emmanuel College Chapel

Name……………………………………………………………………………………………….

The Christian community in College is very diverse with people going to many different

churches and belonging to many different religious societies. This diversity is encouraging

but it can be difficult to keep track of everything that is going on! Without wishing to

compromise the beliefs of any church or group, the Chapel acts as a focus for all this

activity, offering regular worship at the heart of the College.

We use the Chapel email to keep in touch and we try to involve people from as wide a

variety of backgrounds as possible in things like reading from time to time at the main

services.

If you are at all interested in asking questions about faith, or if you are already a practising

Christian, please sign up for the Chapel email list and we will contact you at the beginning

of term.

  I  would like to be kept informed of Chapel events via the Chapel email (we    will use

      your @cam address, which you will be given when you arrive).

  I  would be willing to help with reading in Chapel (we will give you coaching  and an

      opportunity to practise if you would like).

If you would like any help in getting in touch with a church or religious group of any kind in

Cambridge, please indicate here

        Welcome to Emmanuel

Hello!

Emmanuel College Middle Combination Room, University of Cambridge.

Congratulations on joining Emmanuel College — ‘Emma’ as it is affectionately

known — and beginning your new postgraduate course at University of

Cambridge!

Let’s start right at the beginning, because some of you may be wondering what

Emmanuel even is — you thought you were joining Cambridge! Well, you

are. The University of Cambridge is at the same time one thing and many,

being made up of many faculties and departments, and colleges. As a

postgraduate student you will belong to both a University department,

responsible for your education, and to a College, responsible for your pastoral

care, accommodation / dining hall and an important part of your social life.

Here, we are represent the Middle Combination Room, which is both a living

room for post-graduate students and a vibrant postgraduate student body

(emmamcr.org.uk).

                   2  (Table of Contents)
We aim to uphold that our MCR might be one of the friendliest groups at

Cambridge – you do not need to know anybody at our events, just come

introduce yourself and someone will say hi back! Same goes with Catering

hall staff and the Porters. Just stop by, say you’re new, introduce yourself, and

say hi �We might need to hear your name a few times, but persist because

we are here for you.

If you’re here earlier than most folks when term begins in October, or have

any questions, drop us an email at contact@emmamcr.org.uk and we’ll

welcome you to the MCR!

Importance of Freshers Week:

As part of both aspects of our role, we run the Freshers’ Week activities for the

college. The MCR events for Freshers’ will run from Thursday 3rd October to

Sunday 13th October. Essentially Freshers’ Week is a great chance to meet the

rest of your Emma cohort at a range of fun events, from a formal dinner (which

is always followed by an interactive karaoke, Ceilidh or music night) to ‘swap’

dinners at other colleges’ MCR formal dinners to chilled out tea and cake, and

everything in between. There will also be plenty of opportunities to meet folks

and to ask questions. Importantly on the afternoon of Friday 4th October there

will also be a mandatory induction session with lots of important information

about who’s who and what’s what and how things work at Cambridge.

One date for your calendar is Tuesday 8th October: the Freshers’ Dinner,

which is free (super rare!!), starts at 7PM pre-drinks in the Old Library, with

dinner starting at 7:30PM in the Hall. No gowns necessary, but wear

something formal! Please complete this form by Wednesday 25 September

2024, if you have any dietary requirements or allergies that you wish to be

brought to the attention of the College Catering Department or if you do NOT

propose to come to the Freshers' Dinner and/or the Matriculation Dinner.

Important Resources:

The canonical resource for information about the College is the College

website. The documents at www.emma.cam.ac.uk/about/documents are a

comprehensive compilation. The important one is the Domestic Matters

document.  For        information     from  the  University,                       see

www.cambridgestudents.cam.ac.uk.

                                   3             (Table of Contents)
A current Emmanuel postgraduate student (known as a Duck) is assigned to

each fresher (Duckling). Ducks are happy to answer questions about

Cambridge and College. Once you arrive in Cambridge, your Duck will

arrange to meet all of their Ducklings.

Postgraduate students at Emma come from a wide range of backgrounds and

spend their time in Cambridge doing an even wider range of things. As you

peruse these pages, we hope you feel the same excitement about your time

here that we do every day. We look forward to meeting you very soon indeed!

Directions to the Main College Site

By Train

Direct trains to Cambridge are available from a number of locations. From

London (Kings Cross and Liverpool Street) trains leave half-hourly

throughout the day, with tickets available at the station. Timetables are at

www.nationalrail.co.uk and on the Trainline app. We highly recommend you

get a Rail Card for a third of discount which will pay itself off very quickly:

https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/railcards/national-railcards/. See the map for

directions from the railway station to Emma. It’s a 15-minute walk: straight

down Station Rd, turn right onto Hills Rd. and continue into the city centre

                                     5                      (Table of Contents)
(and Emma). Buses run to the city centre (with a stop right outside the College)

every 10 minutes, and there’ll be plenty of taxis available. To book in advance,

try Panther at 01223 715 715.

By Bus or Coach

National Express, Stagecoach and MegaBus run coach services from most

major locations in the country (including airports) to Cambridge. These will

arrive at Parker’s Piece (Parkside stop), the large open space adjacent to

College. For timetables and prices, see www.nationalexpress.com or

www.uk.megabus.com.        For  more          maps  of  the  University,  visit

www.cam.ac.uk/map. For local buses, the main bus station is located at

Drummer Street, also next to the College.

By Air

The closest airport to Cambridge is London Stansted. A direct train, as well as

buses, connect it to Cambridge (~40 minutes). If coming from outside Europe,

London Heathrow is usually the 1st port of call. National Express offers direct

coaches to Cambridge from both Heathrow and Gatwick.

By Car

If driving into Cambridge, you should be aware that a large number of the

roads in the centre are one-way streets. Also be aware that there will be a lot

of cyclists. On some one-way streets, cyclists alone may travel in both

directions; these streets aren’t always marked. While parking outside the main

entrance to Emma is not possible, Emmanuel has short term parking available

with access from Park Terrace, Parker Street and Emmanuel Street. If in need

of help finding the parking access or opening the gates, seek assistance at the

College’s Porters’ Lodge.

If your course is longer than one year (e.g. PhD) you will be eligible to be

included in a ballot for rooms in subsequent year that is held in February each

year. College rooms are single dormitory-style rooms, with shared kitchens,

bathrooms and common areas. Couples’ flats are self-contained and available

by waitlist. Most houses have a Bedder who will empty communal bins,

vacuum, and clean in communal areas. Onsite accommodation (including

Park Terrace) has been designed for residents to use the Hall for food and the

centralised laundry service.

Rent

Rent is calculated based on the grade of room, distance from college, year of

arrival and inflation in subsequent years. The figures below apply for students

joining the college this year, living on the main College site.

For everyone living in College accommodation, a Contribution to Fixed Costs

(CFC) is included in the rent. In exchange for paying this charge, food at

Informal Hall is discounted. Those who live closer to College pay a higher

CFC than those who live further away as it’s expected they’ll eat in Hall more

often. Those who live out of College accommodation and in couples’ flat don’t

pay CFC and therefore don’t have any discount. Please note, that you will be

charged from the date agreed in your accommodation email, not the actual

arrival date.

the Graduate Union or new from Ryder and Amies, 22 King’s Parade

(www.ryderamies.co.uk). New gowns can cost from £60–190.

College Room

College accommodation provides each student a single room equipped with

a bed, coffee table, desk, lamp, chair, bookshelf, rubbish bins (recycling and

general), and drawers or wardrobe. Some rooms will include a small

refrigerator (or access to one in a nearby kitchen). Some rooms have few power

outlets, so bring a strip multiplug adaptor (non-strip style is banned in

college). You are not allowed to sublet your room while you are away or

copy the room key. Overnight external guest (non-members) must be register

if  staying       for  more       than                one  night                via

www.emma.cam.ac.uk/life/facilities/accommodation/visitor/               (Raven

required). Only one guest is allowed at a time. Detailed information about

visitors can be found in the document called College Regulations, you can find

it          here       under            Other                           Information:

www.emma.cam.ac.uk/admissions/graduates/freshers/

be useful.

Kitchen

All postgraduate houses have their own kitchens, so it is advisable to bring

some basic kitchen items if you intend to be cooking regularly, e.g. plate, bowl,

cups, cutlery. However, kitchens are shared between several postgraduate

students so there may be some communal crockery available that has been left

by previous students.

Laundry

There are 3 washing machines + drier in the college for postgrads in the North

Court. Please book a slot at the Porters’ Lodge. You may want an airing rack,

this is especially handy for airing sports gear. Each Emma student can have

one 4.5kg bag laundered per week in the Laundry Service (East Court).

Bookings must be made via CASC (Raven needed). You can find ‘How to

Book’ instruction here: www.emma.cam.ac.uk/life/facilities/roombooking/

Drop off Laundry bags: Monday to Wednesday, 7am to 12pm.

Sports

Emmanuel has several free sports facilities, including an indoor gym, squash

courts, tennis courts, football and rugby pitches, a cricket pitch, ping pong,

croquet, and an outdoor swimming pool. It is advisable to bring appropriate

sports gear and proper shoes for these activities. The local area is ideal for

cycling. Squash racquets and balls are available at the MCR and tennis

racquets are available at the Porters’ Lodge for student use.

Transport

Most students find a bike very helpful. Make sure you bring or buy a sturdy

D lock, lights, and a helmet. Repair tools and emergency bike lights are

available in the Porters’ Lodge. Bike theft is a problem in Cambridge so you

may not want to bring a bike that would be expensive to replace. Second-hand

bicycles can be purchased in several shops in town and new bikes are on sale

at the Freshers’ Fair on Parker’s Piece.

If you intend to cycle in Cambridge it is probably worth joining

www.cyclinguk.org, who offer third party liability insurance to all members.

The        college’s   Health             &   Safety           Handbook               (at

www.emma.cam.ac.uk/about/documents) has some advice on cycling.

Railcard

If you’re interested in cheap train travel, you can apply at www.railcard.co.uk/

or a train station for a 16-25 Railcard to get 33% off all rail fares for a year. If

                                          15                   (Table of Contents)
you’re aged between 16 to 25 years old, you’ll need a passport photo and proof

of your date of birth (e.g. passport, UK driving licence, birth certificate or, for

non-UK nationals, national identity card). If you’re over 25 but studying full-

time, you still qualify but need proof that you’re in full time education. In

addition, there's also a 26-30 Railcard that might be suitable for the students’

partners who don’t qualify for the student Railcard.

Do not bring…

YOU WON’T NEED A CAR. More specifically, you are not allowed to keep a

car in Cambridge without permission from your Tutor (see the University

Proctors’ pronouncement at www.proctors.cam.ac.uk

and      www.proctors.cam.ac.uk/documents, specifically concerning motor

vehicle  www.proctors.cam.ac.uk/documents/motor-proctor-4-2.pdf).                    Car

parking is expensive and unreliable.

DON’T BRING A PET as they are not allowed in College accommodation.

DON’T BRING NETWORKING EQUIPMENT, as all accommodation has

Wi-Fi.

Finally, college is fairly  strict    on      furniture  —  so  NO   BEDS            OR

MATTRESSES EITHER.

Welfare

IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY IN COLLEGE ALWAYS GO TO THE

PORTERS’ LODGE FIRST. They are your first point of contact and always

able  to  help.      You  can  find  important       contact    details  here:

https://apps.emma.cam.ac.uk/life/welfare/emergency/

The primary role of College is to ensure the wellbeing and welfare of all

students throughout their time at Emma. Welfare at Emmanuel College

concerns a broad range of topics with a variety of resources, channels and

people who are here to help you through your studies. Postgraduate study is

not always easy, but in the right environment, and with the right support

networks, it can be both manageable and enjoyable.

Acute financial and accommodation issues are common, and academic

difficulties (in particular concerning careers) are faced by almost everybody at

some point. The college is an environment in which people feel comfortable

discussing all these challenges and the various resources it offers can often be

a great starting point towards resolving them.

Should you have any queries or concerns regarding welfare at Emmanuel

College or any pre-arrival access or support requirements, contact the College

Registrar (college-registrar@emma.cam.ac.uk). You should also always feel

free to reach out to the MCR Welfare Officers at welfare@emmamcr.org.uk or

other members of the MCR Welfare Team.

College Welfare

The Tutorial System

The College has a statutory duty and many years of experience concerning

issues facing postgraduate students. This mainly occurs through the tutorial

system; Tutors, who are academics and Fellows of the College, individually

respond to welfare issues and collectively plan to prevent their occurrence.

The University has produced a concise description of how this tutorial

support works, www.studentsupport.cam.ac.uk/.

There are three Tutors whose main focus concerns postgraduate students, yet

anyone may approach any Tutor with any issue. Many undergraduate Tutors

                                     20                         (Table of Contents)
supervise masters and PhD students so are keenly aware of situations

postgraduate students face.

In addition to reacting to welfare issues, Tutors can help proactively with

topics such as career direction and conference funding; if there is something

you might need during your time as a student, you should definitely ask.

More      about  funding     opportunities       you      can  find  here:

Disability

Emmanuel College is committed to ensuring that all postgraduate students

with a disability receive the support they need to fully participate in

Cambridge life and do not face any discrimination. You can contact your

Postgraduate   Tutor,  or   the  MCR’s         Disabled   Students’         Rep,

(disabilities@emmamcr.org.uk) whose role is to represent all students with

any visible or invisible condition. We also encourage anyone with a disability

to contact the College Disability Liaison Officer before you arrive for any

specific advice or information, and to ensure there is appropriate support

upon arrival.

College Disability Liaison Officer - college-registrar@emma.cam.ac.uk

In practice at Cambridge, the definition of ‘disability’ includes a wide range

of conditions such as

●  Mental health conditions i.e., anxiety, depression, and BPD

●  Autism spectrum conditions

●  Sensory impairments i.e., hearing and visual

●  Specific learning difficulties i.e., dyslexia or ADHD

●  Physical impairments and injuries i.e., wheelchair users and upper

   limb disorder

●  Long-standing conditions i.e., cancer, HIV, chronic fatigue, epilepsy,

   syndrome, diabetes

There are many resources available within the University for disabled

students. It is important to note that you are not required to self-define as

disabled in order to access this support and you have complete control over

disclosure of your disability to different departments and faculties. Support

is mainly accessed through the Accessibility and Disability Resource Centre

Emmanuel has their own disability advisor at the ADRC and they will be able

to discuss with you any support that you may benefit from as well as

reasonable adjustments for your studies, which there is a legal requirement

for the University to put in place for you. This support can take any form from

changes to your living or learning environment, or to particular provisions,

criteria or practices (e.g. placing automatic doors at the entrance to your

faculty building, providing large print materials, extra time or rest breaks in

exams, specialist mentoring etc.).

It may be useful or necessary to have an occupational health assessment in

your new department. Be sure to check whether you should self-refer or if a

management referral is needed www.oh.admin.cam.ac.uk/services/referral-

Healthy Relationships

Being a Fresher at Emma is exciting, particularly as we’re known for being the

friendliest college! This year you’ll have the opportunity to meet many new

people, forming friendships in Emma and in the wider Cambridge

community, getting to know college staff and working with your supervisor.

Emma is committed to being an inclusive, friendly, and safe community for

all who study and work here. As an MCR, we uphold this college ethos and

would like to take the opportunity to encourage you to consider some aspects

of postgraduate study which you may not have thought about before. These

topics will be presented and discussed in greater depth during the college

induction sessions.

New Relationships

Relationships with Supervisors and College Staff

● Consider that it may be difficult to define friendship and professional

boundaries.

● Be aware of differences between the roles of your Supervisor, Advisor,

Postgraduate Tutor and the relationships you will form with them.

● The hierarchical structures and authority within college may differ from

your undergraduate experience.

                                      26                          (Table of Contents)
●  Addressing emails or conversations can be stressful with so many

   esteemed academics around. Usually including a title and surname in the

   address is appropriate, although certain professors may encourage you to

   use first names once they reply.

●  Not all relationships will come easily. You may need to work to improve

   relations or take a more proactive role than previously experienced with

   supervisors. Remember to stay respectful and appropriate but do not be

   afraid to stand up for yourself.

Relationships within the MCR — building a successful community

● We all need to be aware of the wellbeing of others. This includes being

   patient and remembering that many people have different backgrounds

   and may suffer from invisible issues.

● The college environment is an intimate community with shared

   accommodation. Be aware of the implications of gossip.

● We live in and embrace a multicultural community. Be aware of linguistic,

   logical, and cultural hurdles that must be overcome on both sides.

● The transition from undergraduate to postgraduate study can be confusing

   and raise unexpected problems. Do not be afraid to ask for help.

Maintaining Relationships

As a postgraduate student, you may be arriving in Cambridge with a long-

term partner. Please remember that the MCR offers an associate member

status for members’ spouses or live-in partners. As an associate member of the

MCR, your partner is welcome at all of our events, even unaccompanied!

Bullying and Harassment

Emmanuel College is committed to providing a safe environment in which all

members of the College can participate freely and contribute fully without fear

for their personal security and wellbeing. A safe environment free of

harassment or threat is fundamental to the academic and social life of our

community. Sexual harassment and sexual misconduct will not be tolerated.

The College will support and assist the victim of any harassment or sexual

misconduct.

On the College website (www.emma.cam.ac.uk/about/documents) you will

find official documents and policies including:

- Code of Conduct for students regarding harassment, sexual harassment,

   and sexual misconduct

                                          27               (Table of Contents)
-  College Statement on sexual harassment and sexual misconduct

-  College Advice on sexual harassment and sexual misconduct

-  Emmanuel College Guidance on, and procedures for handling cases of,

   sexual harassment or sexual misconduct raised by a student (or students)

   about another student (or students)

Any criminal behaviour will be reported to police. If you are made to feel

uncomfortable by any MCR member, please reach out for help from the

committee (particularly the Welfare Officers). You may also submit a

complaint            following          either  the              university

(www.studentcomplaints.admin.cam.ac.uk/harassment-and-sexual-

misconduct)  or      college    (www.emma.cam.ac.uk/about/documentsf)

procedures.

Harassment may include verbal, physical, emotional, and sexual harassment.

Sexual harassment may include sexually charged comments or questions as

well as physical contact, including sexualized dancing or touching if consent

has not been established or is not maintained.

Consent

As well as forming friendships, you may engage in sexual relationships

during your time here, either with new partners or in an already established

relationship. Even if you are confident that you are informed about consent, it

is important that you review this section. It is vital to feel confident and safe

with your partner and to always be considerate towards them. Even in

established relationships, situations may change. Conversations about

consent are important, as they are context-specific and can be complex at

times. Below are some key ideas which should be included in this discussion:

Informed

There should be a thorough understanding about what is being asked for and

consented to. Consent to sex, for example, is not the same as consent to sex

without protection.

Mutual

Consent is communicated between all individuals involved.

                                        28                    (Table of Contents)
Active

Consent should be a continual communication between all involved, and all

should feel engaged and involved in this communication. This means that

consent is not only a one-time affirmation, but continued and repeated.

Sober/Capable

There are situations in which intoxication means consent isn’t possible: when

your partner is for example having difficulty speaking or standing. However,

everyone has different limits and boundaries, and drunkenness doesn’t

automatically invalidate consent. The best way to determine if someone

consents to sex after drinking is to check in with the person repeatedly to

ensure that they’re capable of communicating their needs. If there is ever any

doubt, confusion, or supposed mixed-messages, don’t do it.

Communicated

Use words and actions that are mutually understandable. For all sorts of

reasons people might find communicating in a certain way (e.g. verbally)

difficult. The method of communication may differ, but the message does not.

However, be wary of reading into actions. Neutral behaviour, or not saying

no, is NOT consent—consent is affirmative (e.g. “yes”).

Retractable

Consenting to one sexual act does not mean consenting to all sexual acts.

Consent can also be retracted at ANY time, and any and all sexual acts should

be stopped until consent is re-established.

Willing

Agreement can never count as consent if someone is forced. If you agree after

being threatened, this is not consent, and any sexual acts following may be

considered assault.

Alcohol

It is important to highlight that the MCR is an inclusive, diverse community

where we respect everyone’s choice whether or not to drink. You don’t need

to drink to enjoy our events and at formals we offer a discounted price for

those not drinking and non-alcoholic alternatives. It is important to be aware

of how much you are drinking and speak to someone if you feel things are

getting out of control. Remember that you are entirely responsible for your

behaviour at all times, even under the influence of alcohol or other substances.

                     29                                     (Table of Contents)
Drinks should always be enjoyed responsibly and know your limits. During

MCR events, you can also always reach out to committee members, especially

the welfare officers, if you have any concerns.

Sexual Harassment and Assault

The College will support and assist the victim of any sexual harassment or

sexual misconduct. In the event of harassment and assault, please refer to the

official documents and policies mentioned above (available on the College

website www.emma.cam.ac.uk/about/documents. A few key points are

highlighted below.

In an emergency or immediately following an assault

●  Go somewhere that you feel safe.

●  If you need the Police or other services, contact them immediately              by

   dialling 999

●  The  advice      provided    by   Rape        Crisis  can  be  accessed         at

   www.rapecrisis.org.uk

In College, the Porters’ Lodge will always be a safe place from where you can

contact help and assistance. The Porter on duty will contact the Duty Tutor,

provide useful telephone numbers, or summon assistance on your behalf.

Who can you contact after an assault?

It can be difficult to talk about an assault to friends or family, yet it is very

important to have understanding and support. There are a number of different

people you may choose to contact for support and advice. There is no single

or correct route by which to seek support.

Within College the following people are available to support and advise you,

in no particular order:

   ●    Your Postgraduate Tutor

   ●    Any other Tutor who you wish to approach (Moodle for PGs –

        Tutorial Times)

   ●    The Senior Tutor

   ●    The Postgraduate Tutor

   ●    The Advisor to Women Students

   ●    The Dean

   ●    The College Counsellor

   ●    The College Nurse

   ●    MCR Women's Officer

                                       30                         (Table of Contents)
The College can assist you, and direct you to, any professional support and

counselling services that you may need. Whoever you approach, the matter

will be treated sensitively and in confidence. In addition, the Welfare Officers

of the MCR at Emmanuel College and the Welfare Officers at Cambridge SU

(www.cambridgesu.co.uk/aboutus/team/welfareandcommunityofficer)                   are

people from whom you can seek help and advice.

What can the College do to Support You?

No one should feel that they need to cope on their own, and talking to

someone about harassment or an assault is important in and of itself. This is

true whether you talk to someone soon after an incident has taken place or at

some later date.

Whoever you decide to approach in the College, they will direct you to, or

provide, the following services, as appropriate to your needs:

●  Counselling

●  Health advice and treatment (eg. pregnancy and STI screening)

●  Support for your general well-being in college

●  Adjustments to your academic work and support

●  Measures to protect your personal safety

●  Providing advice about the complaint procedures available to you

●  Respecting your confidentiality

●  Helping you to decide whether to approach the Police

●  Reporting sexual assault

●  Information about sexual assault referral centres

●  Other sources of support and advice

Useful Contact Details

Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARC)

SARCs are specialist 24/7 services for people who have been raped or sexually

assaulted. They aim to be one-stop services, providing the following under

one roof: medical care and forensic examination following assault/rape,

counselling and — in some locations — sexual health services. Services are

free of charge and provided to all regardless of gender identity. Most SARCs

are able to offer services to anyone including those who do not wish to report

the assault to the police (‘self referrals’).

The SARC for Cambridgeshire at The Elms (www.theelmssarc.org), in

Hinchingbrooke Hospital, Huntingdon and is available 24/7 to victims by

International Students

Being an international student in the UK comes with challenges, privileges,

frustration and excitement. While things may seem quaintly and traditionally

British, Cambridge is also an incredibly international community, from its

student societies to the culinary delights of Mill Road. You will, no doubt, find

your feet quickly, but in the meantime your International Officer

international@emmamcr.org.uk would be glad to answer any questions you

might have about your arrival and everyday life in the UK.

International Student Team and iCUSU

The University’s International Student Team not only provides support with

your visa applications, but also collects important information for all

international students (EU and Non-EU). For students due soon in Cambridge

please visit www.internationalstudents.cam.ac.uk. Their function as a

university service is to assist with any issue related to being an international

student in the UK.

Visa

The MCR is not qualified to advise on individual visa issues; contact the

College Registrar (college-registrar@emma.cam.ac.uk). Note your visa

responsibilities (outlined at www.internationalstudents.cam.ac.uk/student-

visa-responsibilities) and expect that you may be contacted by the Tutorial

Office about them.

                                         33                       (Table of Contents)
Banking

Soon after arrival, you’ll need to set up a bank account in the UK for local

transactions. This will be a current account, with a card for withdrawals at

cashpoints (ATMs). A vast majority of the ATMs in the UK do not charge a

transaction fee. You’ll be able to organise your finances and make payments

to other UK accounts through electronic banking.

Some of the closest banks to Emmanuel include Barclays, Santander, HSBC,

Lloyds, and Metro but there are many others. Building societies provide most

banking services. Check what options they have for international students

(often, none), or students in general. Try to find a current account with no fees,

or that will let you make withdrawals and transfers without charge from a

bank in your home country.

Use the online request form on the Freshers to request a bank letter

www.emma.cam.ac.uk/admissions/graduates/freshers/verificationrequests

from the College Tutorial Office BEFORE you set up the appointment. Note

that different banks will ask for different things. The letter will probably need

to confirm that you have a guaranteed place on a course that is longer than six

months, and show your address, starting and ending dates — but make sure

to check. Please allow 3 to 5 working days for request to be processed.

Set up an appointment with a bank to open an account. Lines will be long

during Freshers’ Week so try to get there early (~30 min before it opens) to set

up the appointment as there will be a limited number of appointment spots

per day.

Also, a lot of students opt for online banks such as Monzo or Revolut

— there you can convert currencies without charge, and maintaining these

cards is also usually free! As well, you can get a single-use virtual card (also

for free) to protect online purchases.

Verification Documents

The College can provide you with various verification documents

www.emma.cam.ac.uk/life/documents/verification/ (Raven required). Please

allow 3 to 5 working days for request to be processed.

Council Tax

Full-time students are exempt from City Council Tax. Those is non-college

accommodation and college couple flats are responsible for making the

necessary arrangements with City Council. Detailed information available

Health Care

The National Health Service (NHS) is the UK’s state healthcare system

providing a wide range of health care services including doctor’s

appointments,  hospital          treatment  and          dental          care:

www.studentwellbeing.admin.cam.ac.uk (Raven required).

EU nationals and Tier 4 visa holders are entitled to receive certain treatment

from the NHS free of charge in General Practitioner (GP) Surgeries, health care

centres, and hospitals. This applies to your spouse and children if they are in

the UK as your visa dependants.

Non-UK European Economic Area (EEA) nationals and their family should

obtain a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) before coming to the UK.

You must register with a Cambridge doctor (GP) as soon as you arrive in

Cambridge. You can find a list of local practices on the College website

(www.emma.cam.ac.uk/admissions/graduates/freshers).

You will need to pay for dental treatments as well as for any associated

medical prescription to be collected from a pharmacy; dental problems are not

only a pain in the mouth but also in the pocket. Students wishing to register

as an NHS dental patient locally can find out which practices in the city are

accepting NHS patients using the NHS search facility (www.nhs.uk/Service-

Search/Dentist/LocationSearch).

The College also has a nurse who is available during term time to offer advice

to students (nurse@emma.cam.ac.uk). For further details about the full range

of medical support available within College, ask at the Porters’ Lodge (01223

334 200).

If you are living on site and require urgent emergency medical assistance

and are unable to travel to the hospital, contact the Porters’ Lodge

immediately and the duty Porter will call for an ambulance and then attend

regarding first aid if needed. If living in offsite accommodation call 999 and

then call the Porters’ Lodge to inform the duty Porter.

                                 35                      (Table of Contents)
Phones

Almost all the major phone companies will provide you with a pay-as-you-go

SIM card for free, which you can top up as you need. Nearby Emmanuel, you

can check out options at mobile stores like the Carphone Warehouse , or

individual carriers like Three , Vodafone , EE , O2 . Mobile phone contracts are

available but often require credit history. A popular alternative for both PAYG

or contract options is to use online mobile companies like Giffgaff or

Talkmobile, which send you your SIM card by mail. Bring along an unlocked

phone, insert the SIM card, and you should be good to go.

Religion

Emmanuel welcomes anyone, regardless of religious affiliation. Listed below

are a few places within and near college that may be of interest.

Emmanuel Chapel

The Chapel is located straight in front of you as you come through the main

College gate. There are services each Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday

evenings led by the Dean, The Revd Jeremy Caddick (jlc24@cam.ac.uk) — see

www.emma.cam.ac.uk/chapel. All members of Emma and their friends are

welcome. If you are interested in reading in chapel services then get in touch

with the Dean, who is always happy to have more volunteers.

Reflection Room

There is a multi-faith reflection room that is open to anyone for quiet prayer

and contemplation, located in Emmanuel House.

Additionally, there are several religious organizations within Emmanuel

College and in the university. We’ve listed a few below, but all registered

religious societies at the University of Cambridge can also be found at

www.cambridgesu.co.uk/organisation.

Christian Graduate Society: www.cucgs.soc.srcf.net

Islamic Society: www.isoc.co.uk/freshers

Jewish Society: www.cambridgesu.co.uk

Sustainability

In 2017, Emma was awarded the Gold Award from the                 Green  Impact

initiative. We hope you will continue in our efforts to make      Emma   an eco-

friendly place! Here are some tips:

REDUCE

●  Don’t want unwanted ads in your pigeon-hole?  There’s      an  envelope  with

   green stickers on the board inside the

   pidge! Put a green sticker next to your

   name!

●  Don’t forget to switch-off lights and

   unplug devices to minimise energy

   consumption.

●  Report any faults (i.e. leaky taps, faulty

   radiators, etc) through Emma’s online

   maintenance form.

REUSE

●  Grab an Emma Green Duck shopping bag from The Porters’ Lodge.

●  Buy an Emma inscribed reusable Keep Cup from the Cafeteria or

   Fiona’s and get 10% off of every hot drink you get using the cup in the

   College!

RECYCLE

Cambridge is pretty great for recycling, and can handle many materials other

places do not. See www.cambridge.gov.uk/bins-rubbish-and-recycling for

university email address. The university email service is called Hermes and is

provided by Microsoft Outlook.

CRSid

Every Cambridge student is provided with a University email address

(e.g. abc123@cam.ac.uk). The prefix part of the address (in this case, abc123) is

your CRSid. The CRSid together with the UIS password are used to identify

you to various services throughout the University.

Raven

When trying to access any of the university services you’ll be redirected to the

Raven  login       system  to  input  your    CRSid    and     UIS   password

www.legacy.raven.cam.ac.uk/

Before arrival, you will need to collect your account details. You can collect

your CRSid and initial password for Raven by completing the online form

once   you         have        completed      student  registration               (see

www.help.uis.cam.ac.uk/new-starters/it-for-students/getting-started                for

more information). Make a note of your initial password. Once you have

collected your initial password, use it to log in to the UIS Password

Management Application (www.password.raven.cam.ac.uk/ ) and create your

own UIS Password. Your CRSid and this newly created UIS password will be

everything you need to access any of the university services.

Make sure to check your email regularly, as all official communications from

the University will be by email. In the run-up to the start of term, the MCR

Committee will begin emailing you with helpful information and details of

Freshers’ events.

Connecting your own Computer

You will likely need to use computer facilities during your time at Emma.

Most people bring a laptop, and we strongly recommend you do. There is

excellent high-speed internet connectivity in Cambridge. There is internet in

college accommodations (eduroam). This is available to all Emma students

throughout the College and covers much of the city. Wired access points are

provided in the Library and MCR. The college also provides a guide to

connecting, and committee members will host a walk-in session during

Freshers’ week for computing access. If you have any special computing

software or equipment needs, there are funds available to help. Please contact

the Computer Officer (computing@emmamcr.org.uk) to discuss your needs in

confidence.

Set up and use Eduroam

To set up eduroam it is essential to first retrieve your username (your eduroam

identifier) and password (your Network access token) from UCS Tokens

(tokens.uis.cam.ac.uk). You will be first redirected to the Raven login system

to input your CRSid and UIS password. More information can be found at

help.uis.cam.ac.uk/service/wi-fi

College Wi-Fi and Computers

For coverage across Cambridge, eduroam is your best bet. Other off-site

college accommodation has specific connections, for which the password is

EmmaDucks9 if not posted within the building as something else.

The college has three computer rooms that are open 24 hours a day (access

with university card) and have a range of modern PCs. There are printing,

scanning facilities and photocopying facilities in the foyer of the library and

in the Robert Sansom student computer room. There are also two computers

and printing facilities in the MCR, reserved for the use of MCR members.

Sport and other Activities

If you enjoy sports, music, or anything in between, you will find that between

the University and College teams/orchestras/societies and the MCR activities

there’s a lot on offer. It doesn’t matter whether you want to train for hours

every day or just play for fun, there’s something for everyone!

The University offers pretty much every sport going, from football to real

tennis, water polo to ice hockey. The focal point of University club’s season is

the annual varsity match against Oxford, but throughout the year teams

compete at a high level in both regional leagues and the British Universities &

Colleges Sport competitions (BUCS). Some sports may require you to attend

trials in order to gauge your ability, while others take complete beginners.

Check out www.sport.cam.ac.uk to see the list of sports on offer.

As a member of the MCR you are eligible to join the University’s Fitness

Centre, located in West Cambridge. Details about the facilities and signing up

can be found at www.sport.cam.ac.uk. In addition, there is an Emmanuel

College Fitness Suite, details below. Emma also has its own sports grounds on

Wilberforce Road and has an excellent Boathouse and novice training

program for rowing. A big selection of sports clubs, open to all levels are

available within the College.

For the musically minded, a variety of ensembles are provided by the

Cambridge University Music Society, www.cums.org.uk , including concert

and symphony orchestras and several choirs. Most of these are entry by

audition only but there is also a range of university-wide musical societies

open to all abilities. There is the College Choir for those who wish to audition

and also a non-audition chorus, orchestra, big band and folk ensemble that

put on concerts once a term. The Emmanuel College Music Society website

has more details www.emmamusic.co.uk.

For other interests — acting, comedy, juggling — there’s almost certainly a

group or society already existing for you to join. For a full list of all registered

University societie, see www.societies.cam.ac.uk.

For more information about societies, head along to the University Freshers

fair and the Emmanuel Freshers fair. For more information visit the ECSU

               Praelector

                     MATRICULATION FOR AFFILIATED STUDENTS

Affiliated students are those who have a degree from another university and are reading for a

Cambridge BA, which they normally receive after two years study. From an academic point of

view affiliated students are treated as undergraduates and from a social point of view they are

treated as postgraduate students. Affiliated students wear an undergraduate gown.

Matriculation is the formal process of enrolling in the University of Cambridge and specifically in

Emmanuel College. You matriculate by signing the Matriculation Book. Before this ceremony

there will be a group photograph, and afterwards an individual photograph. There are several

online declarations that you need to make before the ceremony as well. It is followed by the

formal Matriculation Dinner to celebrate joining the College and University.

The College Matriculation Ceremony for Postgraduates and Affiliated Students will take place

during the late afternoon of Wednesday 23 October 2024. This is your top priority on that

day and it is not expected that you will be absent.

If you genuinely have a serious reason why you cannot be present then please contact the

Tutorial Office (tutorial-office@emma.cam.ac.uk) without delay.

WHAT TO WEAR

Either:        Undergraduate gown and a plain dark suit with a white shirt, tie and black shoes

or:            Undergraduate gown and a plain dark dress or suit with skirt or trousers with a

               white blouse and black shoes

If you do not already have a gown then you will need to obtain one as soon as you arrive. The

College Students' Union (ECSU) and the Porters will be able to help with this. Gowns can also be

bought from several outfitters in the centre of town.

WHAT HAPPENS

Before the ceremony

Shortly after your arrival you will be sent two links. Please follow both of them and indicate your

agreement before the matriculation ceremony.

The first is to the University Matriculation Form, where you will agree to the following

declarations:

‘I promise to observe the Statutes and Ordinances of the University as far as they concern

me, and to pay due respect and obedience to the Chancellor and other officers of the

University.

                     St Andrew’s Street, Cambridge CB2 3AP

                           www.emma.cam.ac.uk
                                                 2

            I understand that in becoming a member of the above College I accept the

            responsibility of membership of the College and University community and

            agree to abide by the statutes, rules and regulations of these institutions

            and to do nothing that is harmful to the work or reputation of either of

            them.’

You will also be giving consent to the processing by the College and the University of your

personal data for proper purposes (as described in the Data Protection Statement on the College

website www.emma.cam.ac.uk/about/documents/) and promising to observe the provisions

of the Data Protection legislation yourself.

The second document to read is the College Regulations and the College Health & Safety guide

and policy . You will find a copy of both of these in your Freshers’ Pack. Please do read them.

When you follow the link you will be asked to indicate that you agree to abide by them.

ON THE DAY OF THE CEREMONY

Please come to the Old Library correctly dressed and with a gown at 4.45pm promptly.

After the procedure has been explained to you, a group photograph will be taken in Front Court.

After that you are asked to come to the Matriculation Ceremony in groups through the afternoon

wearing your gown and dark clothes. There will be a list showing your individual time on the

noticeboard in the B staircase entrance and in the Old Library.

Then you will write your full name in the College Matriculation Book (in your normal handwriting

i.e. not your signature) and the place of your birth. If you were born in the British Isles, you write

the historic county of your birth (i.e. not necessarily the current local government area). By

tradition, the form of county name for such counties as Yorkshire, Cheshire, Lancashire and so

on is York (as in ‘the County of York’), Chester, Lancaster, etc. If you were born outside the British

Isles you write the area (state, province, department, land etc. and the country (e.g. Gironde,

France; Florida, USA; Shandong Province, China)

Immediately afterwards an individual photograph will be taken.

MATRICULATION DINNER

The Matriculation Dinner will be held on the evening of the same day, Wednesday 23 October.

At 7.00 pm there will be drinks in the Old Library followed at 7.30 pm by Dinner in Hall. Dress is as

for the Matriculation ceremony. Everyone wears a gown.

Please complete this form by Wednesday 25 September 2024, if you have any dietary

requirements or food allergies that you wish to be brought to the attention of the College

Catering Department or if you do NOT propose to come to the Freshers’ Dinner and/or the

Matriculation Dinner – please tick the appropriate box. There is no need to complete this form if

you do not have any dietary requirements.

Thank you.

File: 03.College Counsellor Postgrad welcome 24-25.pdf
Welcome from Tim Ellis, College Counsellor and Mental Health Coordinator

I would like to welcome you, or welcome you back, and to wish you well during your time at

Emmanuel College. As a Postgraduate, you are likely to have considerable personal experience

to draw upon to inform and improve your life here. At the same time, this is a point of change

and challenge, particularly if you are new to the UK. There are many opportunities within the

College community, and the wider University, to help you negotiate this transition and enhance

your time here.

I hope you are settling in well. However, if at any point you want to reach out for support, here

are some of the options:

     •  Your Postgraduate Tutor

     •  Any Postgraduate or Undergraduate Tutor

     •  Your Supervisor/s

     •  MCR (The graduate student community) Welfare representatives

        https://www.emmamcr.org.uk/wp/

     •  College Nurse

     •  College Counsellor (me) counsellor@emma.cam.ac.uk or the24@cam.ac.uk

     •  University Counselling Service (UCS) www.counselling.cam.ac.uk

     •  Sexual Assault and Harassment Advisor (SAHA) www.counselling.cam.ac.uk/sexual-

        assault-and-harassment-advisor

     •  Accessibility and Disability Resource Centre (ADRC) www.disability.admin.cam.ac.uk

     •  Student Advice Service (SAS) www.cambridgesu.co.uk/support/advice/

     •  Your Doctor

As well as academic progress, extracurricular activities and developing social connections,

gaining a better understanding of yourself is likely to be another of the life-long benefits you

derive from being here. That personal development may start from a period of uncertainty or

difficulty.

I aim to provide inclusive and accessible counselling and welfare support, available to every

Postgraduate student. You are welcome to contact me if you have not used counselling before

and are unsure about what it is, or if it can help you. At its heart, it is a conversation focused on

what is important to you. Talking to an experienced professional, in confidence, can often

provide relief or a new perspective.

I see students in college, both in and out of term, with flexibility of appointment times. You can

email me to request an appointment or use the Counselling Request Form

https://www.emma.cam.ac.uk/life/welfare/health/counselling/ I also have a more general

welfare role in college, and you can contact me if you want information about other sources of

support or if you have another welfare query.

I hope you have fulfilling and enriching year ahead.

INFORMATION UPDATES

From time to time information regarding the College and its services will be updated. Please look out fro emails

from the Busar and Senior Tutor communicating any updates.

1. COLLEGE ACCOMMODATION

The basis on which accommodation is provided by the College is different from that provided in many

universities or in the private rental sector. It should be noted that one advantage of this ‘College model

of accommodation’ is that postgraduates only pay rent for the 12 weeks out of 13 weeks of term

arrangement. The accommodation at Emmanuel is not offered on a self-catering basis, instead College

rooms are provided as part of a package which includes access to Hall and the cafeteria. In houses or on

staircases on the College site the gyp rooms provide only very limited facilities – often only microwave and

are intended for the preparation of light snacks only. The facilities are limited by the space available, and

consideration of fire safety etc. Electrical equipment, other than listed at 9(a) below may not be used in

kitchens.

Other facilities are also provided centrally – for example, a central staffed laundry is provided, and no

washing machines are located in individual postgraduate rooms on the College site. Washing

machines and tumble dryers are available in all properties that are not on the main College.

The College regrets that there is no accommodation suitable for infants and children. For those

Postgraduates with children aged 15 and under, the Childcare Office can provide support and information

on         local  childcare  provision,        schools                  and  childcare        bursaries

https://www.childcare.admin.cam.ac.uk/.

2. COLLEGE REGULATIONS REGARDING ACCOMMODATION

College rooms are occupied in accordance with the College Regulations (a copy of which can be

found on the College website https://www.emma.cam.ac.uk/about/documents/). The following

College Regulations set out the formal conditions covering the occupation of rooms:

    11. Sub-letting College accommodation is strictly prohibited. Failure to comply with this rule will

invoke disciplinary proceedings against the individual.

    22. (…) Every student’s College bill for any term shall be paid by the third Wednesday of the next Full

Term with the exception of the Lent Term bill which must be paid by 27th April. The College reserves the

right to levy charges against students whose bills remain unpaid by that date. No student whose education

fees and/or College bill remains overdue shall be allowed to return, or to remain in residence after a

vacation.

3. DATES OF TERMS ETC.

The dates of University & Full Term, and Normal Period of Residence, for the academic year 2024/2025 are

4. UNIVERSITY CARD

Students are issued with a university card when they arrive at College. Cards identify students and provide

access (e.g., to the College Library, faculty libraries and through various College gates) and allow the use

of services (e.g., charging for meals in the College cafeteria).

If your card is lost, stolen or damaged, you should should report this to the Tutorial Office using the

following email address as soon as possible univcard@emma.cam.ac.uk. The University levies a £10 fee

for replacing lost and stolen cards, and charges incurred in this respect are recovered via a student’s

College account. This fee can be avoided if a crime report number is available. Damaged cards are usually

replaced free of charge, as long as the damaged card is returned to the College card representative.

University cards must be returned to the College when you graduate there are arrangements in place for

the cards to be collected immediately prior to graduation day.

5. ROOMS AND KEYS

Allocation of rooms to freshers

Questions concerning the allocation of rooms to postgraduate freshers should be directed to the

Postgraduate Admissions Administrator in the first instance (tutorial-office@emma.cam.ac.uk). Rooms

are allocated to postgraduates by the Postgraduate Tutor. The Bursar is responsible for the decoration,

furnishing and maintenance of rooms. With the Buildings & Services Committee (which includes student

representatives) she is also responsible for setting room rents.

Residence register & lost keys

On every occasion when coming into residence the Residence Register at the Porters’ Lodge must be

signed. Students will then be issued with their room key or have their University card enabled for salto

access if applicable. Students are not permitted to get keys cut at their own expense as all keys must be

procured through the Porters’ Lodge for security reasons.

On every occasion when going out of residence, the Residence Register must be signed, and the room key

returned. Failure to return a room key and to sign the Residence Register on the date of Final Exeat will

make the postgraduate liable to a fine at the discretion of the Senior Tutor, the fine being added to the

postgraduate’s College bill.

Should the room key be lost, a charge, to be agreed annually by the Senior Tutor and Bursar, will be made

and added to the student’s College bill.

If a student mistakenly locks a key inside a room, a temporary key will be issued without charge, provided

it is returned to the Porters’ Lodge the same day.

University cards & gate access

Students will need to present their university card at the Porters’ Lodge so that it can be set to operate

the locks to the various external gates around the main College site.

Clinical medics and vets room ballots

Clinical Medics and Vets are eligible for accommodation for the duration of their 3-year clinical phase.

Rooms for current year 3, 4 and 5 medics are chosen in a room ballot which is held in April. Details of

the room ballot will be circulated in March. Room for vets and other eligible students are chosen in

the General Room Ballot (in April/May).

4th and 5th year Clinical Veterinary students - rent will be charged in the same way as for undergraduates

under the conditions below. There will be three bills covering the three Normal Periods of Residence

(NPR), each allowing you to occupy the room for 10 weeks. You must inform the Tutorial Office of your

departure and arrival dates and if you wish to stay in your room outside NPR. You can leave your

belongings in the room, but you must return the key to the Porters’ Lodge and ask them to email tutorial-

office@emma.cam.ac.uk with confirmation. Periods outside NPR are charged according to the number

of nights you stay.

                                                     6

Clinical Medicine Students – your College room is booked until 31 July for the current academic year.

year 5 and the 2 weeks of summer holiday between year 5 and year 6. Providing the following

commitments are met you will be not charged for the room:

- inform Tutorial Office about summer holiday - Google form will be sent in due course,

- return your key to Porters' Lodge upon departure,

- request Porters to email Tutorial with confirmation that the key has been returned.

2nd 3rd and 4th year PhD students + Clinical Vets room ballots

Rooms for all 2nd, 3rd & 4th year PhD students and Clinical Vets including those from overseas, UK and

Ireland are chosen in a room ballot which is held in the Lent Term. Details of the room ballot will be

circulated in February/March.

Rooms for year 5 PhD students

If you would like to continue your College accommodation, we will add you to the waiting list and let

you know if there are any rooms available once Freshers’ are allocated (late July/August).

Rooms are fully furnished

In general, students in College occupy bed-sitting rooms which are adequately furnished. Each staircase

has bathrooms or showers, WCs and kitchens. Students are not permitted to substitute items of their own

furniture for those supplied by the College, nor are they permitted to add items of their own or remove

College items.

Bed linen

The College will provide a mattress protector, single duvet and one pillow in all rooms as standard.

Please note that sheets, pillowcases, and duvet covers are not provided by the College. If these items

are required, students will need to request a bedding package prior to their arrival, or once they have

moved into their room. This will include a single sheet,duvet cover and one pillowcase. The bedding

package is priced at £15 and will be charged to your College bill. Request a bedding package via the

College website: /apps/helpdesk. Fill in the details required and then choose ‘Household’ as job type

and click ‘Add Job’. A sheet and a pillowcase can be included in your weekly bag of laundry (see para 5a

below).

Crockery and cutlery

Crockery and cutlery are not provided, and these items must not be taken from Hall or the cafeteria.

Pictures and posters

Pictures/posters may be hung on the walls provided that appropriate hooks rather than adhesives

are used (College Regulation No 12 refers). Suitable hooks are available free fromthe Porters’ Lodge

and the ECSU Shop (located by the Post Room) The shop is open during mealtimes and is staffed by

ECSU Committee. It sells sweets, stationery, toiletries & a variety of other bits & pieces you might need

— all of which can be paid for on your College Bill. It also sells personal attack alarms for the low price of

£1.) Nails, Blue Tac, White Tac, drawing pins, Sellotape and other adhesives must not be used on walls

in College rooms.

Inventory

College accommodation is fully furnished. An inventory for a typical room is as follows although precise

provision depends on room size etc. If students experience any problems with these furnishings or have

any special requirements, they should discuss the matter with the Housekeeper, who, in consultation with

the Bursar, may agree to the replacement of the items concerned.

•        1 x bed and mattress                              •    1 x duvet

•        1 x wardrobe                                      •    2x chairs

Condition of rooms

Please remember that rooms are exchanged annually, and that you must leave the room at the end of your

course/the agreed date in the condition in which you found it. The College will charge for all non-

accidental damage to rooms or furnishings, including damage caused by the use of adhesives on walls

(see also above). If rents are to be kept at a reasonable level, it is important to avoid unnecessary

redecoration of rooms.

Vacating rooms at the end of accommodation period

At the end of the rental period, the room must be fully vacated, and all property must be removed. Failure

to empty belongings will result in the student being charged for the additional days that the belongings

remain in the room. Items of property may only be left or stored in the room with the prior written

permission of the Postgraduate Tutor or the Bursar. You must complete online Exeat at least 2 weeks

before the departure

Access to rooms by staff

The following guidelines are intended to ensure that the privacy of students in College

accommodation is respected and, at the same time, that maintenance and other work can be

completed efficiently by the College.

When planned maintenance work is to take place on a staircase or within a house, residents will receive

an email notice 24 hours in advance of the work being carried out and the expected time frame of the

works.

When unplanned works need to be completed quickly, notice will not be possible, but staff will knock

before entering student rooms and take reasonable steps to reschedule their visit should it be

inconvenient at that time.

If you enter a fault or breakage in the maintenance reporting system on the College website, it is taken to

indicate your consent for a member of College staff to enter your room to complete the required repair,

and in those circumstances, notice of the visit to your room may not be given.

Visits to student rooms, staircases, or houses for reasons other than maintenance, for example to

inspect decorations or to plan future works, will be kept to a minimum, and all reasonable steps to

protect the privacy of residents will be observed. Residents will receive an email notice of the

expected time of any such visit at least 24 hours in advance. Repeated visits to a room within the

same Term will be avoided.

Except in cases where security or safety is at risk, a warning will be issued concerning any student’s

possessions which are not permitted in College accommodation. Only if those warnings are not acted

upon will possessions be removed by the College. The Head Porter will act as a point of contact to supply

information should possessions be removed in these circumstances.

The College will warn occupants via email notice suitably in advance of any planned changes to

facilities or equipment on staircases or in houses.

Recycling

The College encourages recycling. This requires residents rubbish to be separated. For rooms on the

main site a recycling bin for paper, cardboard, glass, tins, and plastic bottles is provided in each

student room and will be cleared twice a week by the bedmaker. A recycling bin is also provided in

each gyp room and will be emptied on a daily basis.

In outside properties use is made of the kerbside collection bins provided and emptied by the City

Council. Up to date details of recycling arrangements are provided on the College websites and are

displayed within the entrance hall of each outside property. Please do not put recyclable materials in

the general rubbish bins.

Housekeeping

Housekeeping will visit each staircase/property to clean the gyp rooms, toilets, bathrooms,

communal areas. All postgraduate students are responsible for cleaning their own rooms. Cleaning

equipment (vacuums etc.) are made available for this purpose. The bins provided in student rooms

will be emptied twice a week, and bins provided in gyp rooms will be emptied on a daily basis.

The precise schedule of visits by bedmakers to staircases and houses will vary, but a notice on each

staircase/house will record the arrangement applying there. In addition, the bedmaker on each

staircase will discuss the arrangements with residents.

Bins should not be left in corridors or on landings, as this presents a fire and trip hazard. A ‘do not disturb’

sign should be hung on the door handle if you do not want the bedmaker to enter.

Visitors

After 22.00, all guests of students living on the main College site and offsite must be accompanied by their

host, and all such guests must leave College premises by 02.00, unless only staying for one night or

registered  for  an        overnight  stay.    Overnight    guests  can           be       registered             at:

/life/facilities/accommodation/visitor. College Regulations 20–23 include further information.

Residence out of normal periods

Postgraduate Students: depending on the course for which they are studying, some postgraduates

occupy their College rooms on the same basis as undergraduate students, and the rent paid by them

only coverstheNPR. Otherpostgraduatespayahighertermlyrentandareentitledtooccupytheirrooms

for 13 weeks each term.

Undergraduate Students (including clinical vets year 4 and 5): Rents paid by undergraduates cover

only the Normal Period of Residence, not the University Terms. Undergraduates wishing to stay in

College outside the Normal Period of Residence must obtain the permission of the Senior Tutor

and/or the Bursar and pay a rent of £18.20 per day. Such permission will normally be given to

overseas students, but only to a limited number of home students, who must have an exceptional

reason for staying in Cambridge.

Guest rooms booked for a period beyond the Normal Period of Residence in the EasterTerm mustbe

paid for in advance, before accommodation can be reserved.

6. ANUK

Together with all other Colleges in Cambridge, Emmanuel College     observes          the  ANUK  code             of

practice in the provision of student accommodation and services.

7. LAUNDRY AND IRONING

A laundry is situated in East Court which is at the north-east end of the Paddock. The service provides

for the washing (but not ironing) of one 4.5 kg bag/week of laundry. This bag can include a sheet and

a pillowcase. The cost of this service is included in the room rent on your termly College bill. Students

need to purchase a reusable laundry bag from the Laundry (at a cost of £15) and have their name

clearly visible on the outside. Please sign in on the sheet provided when leaving your laundry bag.

Laundry services will not be provided to students outside of NPR and bank holidays, regardless of

permission to stay in residence over the Vacation period. Laundry services are not provided to

students living in private accommodation.

There is a small launderette in the North Court Cloisters, which can be used by students to launder

items which are unsuitable for the College laundry. Keys to are available in the Porters' Lodge and

must be signed for and returned after each use of the machines. There is no charge for this facility

and all students can use it whether they are in College or private accommodation.

There are ironing rooms in North Court and the Hostel. All outside postgraduate properties are equipped

with an iron, an ironing board and a designated ironing area. You must iron in this area and report any

equipment faults immediately to the Maintenance Helpdesk | Apps | Emmanuel College, Cambridge

8. LUGGAGE STORAGE

Currently there are no storage spaces available for postgrads. If you need to store your belongings you will

need to arrange that with a commercial storage company at your own cost. A number of student luggage

storage companies operate in Cambridge on a collect-and-store basis and their details can be found

online.

9. GUEST ROOMS

Guest rooms can be booked via an online booking form at: /conferences/accommodation/ guestrooms.

Alternatively, students can call 34255, or come into the Bursary between 9am and 12noon only to book a

room. Student rates are £29.05 for a basic single and £58.30 for a basic twin. The College does not accept

guest room bookings for guests who are under the age of eighteen, even if they are accompanied.

Bookings without 24-hour notice will not be accepted. If an online request form is submitted after 12noon,

it will be dealt with the following morning. Likewise, if a telephone message is left in the afternoon, it will

be dealt with the following morning. All submission forms and telephone calls will be dealt with between

9am and 12noon daily.

The maximum number of rooms that can be booked by a student is two – two singles or a twin and a single

– for up to 7 nights. Students, College clubs and societies, needing to book more than two rooms, should

contact the Bursar. No room can be booked provisionally, and no specific room can be requested. Guests

may only stay in guest rooms as long as the student is resident in College accommodation. The address

of the room being booked will not be made available in advance to those booking. The Porter’s Lodge can

be used as a point of reference, if necessary.

Students may charge the cost of a guest room to their College bill (their CRSid will be required). However,

if a student books a guest room during their final term, payment in advance will be required (cash, credit

card or cheque only). If a student wishes to book a guest room for those attending graduation, payment

must be made on booking.

If there is a cancellation within 7 days of the booking, there will be no refund. If the cancellation is more

than 7 days in advance, the room charge will be refunded, minus a £20 admin fee/room.

10. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

Electrical

No alterations may be made in the electrical fittings of College rooms, except by members of the maintenance

staff, or by those who have been authorised by the College.

Additional heating or cooling devices may not be introduced into College rooms.

All privately owned electrical equipment used in College accommodation is the responsibility of the owner. All

such equipment must conform to either British Standards (BS) or European (EU) regulations. No electrical

appliances, apparatus, leads, adaptors, transformers or plugs, other than BS or EU stamped, are permitted.

                          St Andrew’s Street                 www.emma.cam.ac.uk

                          Cambridge CB2 3AP                  @emmanuelcambridge
                                                 10

Particular care must be taken to avoid overloading the electrical supply system. The use of 3-way adapters is

not allowed. Multi-gang fused sockets only may be used. These may be obtained from the Maintenance

Department and charged to your College bill.

While residents in the College and College hostels are responsible for the safety of their equipment, they, and

College staff, have a duty to report any unsafe wiring or equipment which they may notice immediately.

Energy saving

Any waste of electricity or heating increases the cost of operating College accommodation, and in

turn increases room rents. It also damages the environment. Do not bring to College unnecessary

electrical equipment, for example, all College rooms already have adequate lighting. Turn off all

electrical equipment when you leave your room. Do not leave equipment on standby.

Electrical equipment for cooking

Microwaves have been installed in some gyp rooms in College and in outside properties. Instructions

for the use of these microwaves are displayed in these kitchens. Microwaves must not be removed

from the gyp room where they have been placed. The following electrical household appliances may

be brought to College for use only in gyp rooms: toasters, kettles, coffee makers, sandwich toasters,

rice cookers, slow cookers, blenders, juicers, grilling machines, bread makers and air fryers.

Equipment such as deep fat fryers, hot plates and tabletop cookers is not permitted in College

accommodation. If any other appliances are found in College rooms, they will be confiscated.

Old Court

The City Fire Office has instructed that except for kettles, no other electrical cooking equipment may

be used in Old Court sets.

Computers, mobile phone chargers, etc.

Electrical equipment such as computers, mobile telephone chargers etc. must be turned off and

unplugged when the room is unoccupied. Laptop computers used in the library must be unplugged

when not in use.

3D printers

3D printers are not permitted in College rooms.

Lighting

Other than the light provided by the College, only one additional light, using a low energy maximum

28-watt bulb, may be used in student rooms.

General safety precautions

Candles, barbecues, inflammable solvents, fairy lights, paper lampshades, plug-in air fresheners and lava

lamps are not allowed on any College property, because of the danger of fire. Any student found burning

a candle in their room will be liable to a fine at the discretion of the Senior Tutor.

Automatic door closers must not be disconnected, and fire doors throughout College, including those

in the library, must not be propped open. Any interference with fire doors reduces the effectiveness of

the fire precautions and jeopardises the safety of all residents.

It is forbidden to interfere with sealed radiator valves.

Smoking is not permitted in any College room (see below for more general restrictions on smoking

within the College site).

It is forbidden for residents to access the roofs of any College buildings. Any student who goes onto

                            St Andrew’s Street             www.emma.cam.ac.uk

the roof areas will be liable to a fine, or be asked to vacate College accommodation, at the discretion of

the Postgraduate Tutor.

Repairs/Faults

The College website has a system for logging jobs for the attention of the maintenance staff, household

department, IS department and the Porters. This can be found here (/apps/maintenance). Reports are

reviewed daily, and all items are investigated, and appropriate action taken. Please note that it is essential

that jobs are logged properly, reporting an issue to the Porters is not a substitute for this, as the Porters

cannot be expected to relay messages to the other teams responsible. Any matter which has safety

implications (i.e., the replacement of light bulbs in public areas) should be indicated in the reporting

system and remedial action will be taken as soon as possible. Each member of the College must take

responsibility for reporting a fault or breakage which has safety implications. It should not be assumed

that it has already been reported by someone else.

Fridges

All students in Collegeaccommodation have access to a fridge, located near or in theirroom. Fridges

must not be moved.

Television sets

Theuseofprivatetelevisionsetsinroomsisallowed,providedthattheoccupantholds theappropriate

licence. It is your responsibility to obtain a TV licence to watch broadcast or BBC streaming programmes.

Your home licence will not cover you unless you only use a device that’s powered solely by its own internal

batteries and not connected to the mains, and there is no College-wide cover. Full details are available

at: https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/for-your-home/students-aud1

TV licensing authorities make checks on a regular basis, and you are personally liable for any fines

imposed.

11. SHARPS BOX

Sharps boxes for the safe disposal of syringes etc. are available in the Housekeeper's Office in the Hostel

basement, and in the Porters’ Lodge. Syringes etc. must not be disposed of in wastepaper bins.

Consideration for safety of bedmakers and other members of staff must be shown in the disposal of such

material. A student who requires a personal sharps box in their room should contact the Housekeeper.

12. SAFE DISPOSAL OF BROKEN GLASS

To avoid injuries to others, all broken glass, and other items which might cause injury if handled, must be

disposed of in the special bins provided in kitchens and must not be left in wastepaper bins, sinks,

14. MAIL

Mail for student residents in College is placed in pigeonholes in the post room by the Porters. Postgraduate

students who live out of College, and work for the most part in a university department should contact the

Head Porter to have their mail forwarded to their department.

During intermission or LTWA (Leave To Work Away), mail is forwarded to students’ an alternative address

if the Porters’ Lodge has been informed of one). The student must advise how long this is to continue. If

there is a high-cost implication in forwarding mail, the student will be contacted by the Porters’ Lodge to

agree how to proceed. Once students have left the College, mail will continue to be forwarded to them for

up to 6 months.

15. BICYCLES

Cycle racks are provided in: Chapman’s Garden, East Court, North Court, the Basement of Janus

House and some outside properties. All bicycles must be registered with the Head Porter and must

bear the allotted College number.

There has been an increase in bike thefts and students are advised not to leave their bicycles outside the

front entrance to the College. These racks are for the use of visitors who have business in the College and,

given the risks of theft, are not suitable for bikes to be left for longer periods. Bicycles improperly parked

are liable to be removed by the Porters.

Bicycles may not be brought inside the College, except to wheel them from the gate to the nearest cycle

shed or rack. They may not be wheeled through Front Court other than on the direct route from the front

gate to the Chapman’s Garden cycle sheds. They may not be stored or kept elsewhere in the College, nor

may they be leaned against the walls of College buildings. (College Regulation 50 refers). Bicycles must

not be stored in any College rooms or the common parts of College properties. Obstructions will be

removed from College property if left in common areas.

20. SECURITY & INSURANCE

Personal belongings

The College accepts no responsibility for the personal possessions of students, and you are advised to

ensure that doors are locked, and windows closed whenever your room is unoccupied - even for very short

periods. All windows have catches, but if you have a ground or first floor room you can contact the Head

of Maintenance to request that a window lock be fitted. You can make this request before coming into

residence if you wish. If there is a fault with a ground floor window or window lock, please report this via

the maintenance reporting system on the College website as soon as possible Helpdesk | Apps |

Emmanuel College, Cambridge

The College cannot take responsibility for monies that are stolen from rooms. It is advised that you set-up

a bank account immediately upon arriving if not before. If you intend to keep large amounts of money in

your room, then you must invest in a lockable safe box and not rely on drawers or secret places.

Accommodation in multiple occupancy houses and staircases offers tempting opportunities for thieves:

there is much coming and going and it is all too easy for a stranger to disappear into the background. For

this reason, it is important that strangers encountered on staircases should be challenged politely and

asked who they are visiting, and the room number they are looking for: this is usually enough to deter

someone who does not know the answer. If answers are unsatisfactory, such incidents should be reported

to the Porter on duty without delay. Similar precautions should also be taken in the Boathouse and at the

Sportsground.

Insurance

A basic level of contents insurance applies automatically to anyone living in College rooms. The cost of

this insurance is included within the room rents. The full details of the cover is available from the

College website. It is not possible to opt out of it but you can top up and extend the basic cover.

CCTV

There are close circuit television cameras installed at various locations around the College. These are

connected to a recording system. The Bursar is in overall charge of the CCTV system, and the Head Porter

manages it on her behalf. The object of the system is to create a safer working and living environment, and

to protect property. In the event of an incident, the CCTV recording would be used in an attempt to identify

those responsible. The system will not be used to infringe an individual’s right to privacy. Any enquiry

relating to the CCTV system and its operation should be directed, in the first instance, to the Bursar. The

College CCTV policy can be found on the College website.

SMOKING

The College is a smoke-free site, and smoking  is  not  permitted  in  any  part  of  the  College  buildings     or

grounds including but not limited to:

responsibility for one of the beds (or shared between friends). The beds can have anything you would like

to grow in them (fruit, vegetables or cut flowers). The Garden Department are available for support but

these spaces are designed to bring the College community together and aid to general wellbeing. For

further details please contact the Head Gardener.

23. RESPECTING OTHERS

We are committed to providing a welcoming, supportive and collaborative environment where

individuals are treated with respect and dignity. Staff, Fellows and students must behave

appropriately at all times, and any behaviour which causes offence, whether intentional or not, will

be treated very seriously. We are all responsible for ensuring that staff, Fellows and students are able

to contribute fully to the life and work of the College, free from harassment. It is the unwanted nature

of the behaviour which distinguishes harassment from friendly behaviour, which is welcome and

mutual.

   per person.

•  Tuesday and Thursday evenings are open to clubs and societies and larger numbers of guests

   up to 10 guests per Emmanuel student (although you can book without guests).

So that the correct number of meals may be provided, and specific dietary requirements met without

undue waste, kitchen staff need to know how many people will be attending Formal Hall. You must

therefore book in advance by 1900, three days (72hrs) except for group bookings which must be booked

at least 10 days in advance (see below) before you intend to dine. Tables cannot be reserved in advance.

•       Each Tuesday and Thursday, when group bookings are possible, up to 10 non- Emmanuel guests

        may be booked into Hall at the above prices. Students should note that it is the group organiser’s

        responsibility to notify the Head Chef of any dietary requirements, and that it may not be possible

        to accommodate last minute dietary notifications. To avoid disappointment, please organise any

        group Formal Hall well in advance.

•       One of the College’s public rooms (other than Hall) may be booked via the Head of Catering for a

        private or a club/society dinner. Formal Hall prices will not apply to such a booking.

•       During Normal Period of Residence, online cancellation is permitted without penalty, until 1845

        the day before. After this deadline, an email should be sent to the Head of Catering, no later than

        1000 on the day of the meal. After 1000 on the day of the meal, it is not possible to cancel, and the

        price of the meal will be charged to your College bill.

Formal Hall is a special occasion, and students should always have regard for their fellow diners, College

property and staff. This means:

•       Gowns must always be worn by members of the College in Formal Hall

•       Dinner starts at 1930 and you and your guests must arrive promptly before 1915. Entry to Formal

        Hall will be refused if you are late.

•       Members of College staff will refuse admission to anyone who, in their opinion, is not in a fit state

        to participate in Formal Hall

•       You have been asked to specify in advance, for yourself and for your guests, any food allergies or

        other food restrictions. Dishes will have been prepared for you to take into account those

        restrictions, and staff have been instructed to serve only the dish which has been prepared for you.

•       Staff need to know that everyone has remained in their original seats so that the correct dishes can

        be served to those who have reported food allergies. Therefore, you must remain seated during

        Formal Hall and are not allowed to move round the Hall during dinner.

•       Table setting objects must not be removed from Hall.

•       You can take photographs after the Fellows have left the Hall or after coffee has been served. If

        you choose to do so, you are expected to respect the privacy of the other diners and the reputation

        of the College.

•       There must be no toasting, singing, or drinking games. The Hall is licensed premises, and

        rowdiness and drinking games breach the terms of the College’s alcohol licence.

Breach of these guidelines will be considered a disciplinary matter and will be dealt with by the Senior

Tutor and the Master & Tutors' Committee.

DIETS & ALLERGIES

Special diets

Vegetarian and other diet dishes are always available in the cafeteria, and at Formal Hall. Please consult

the Head Chef (na385@emma.cam.ac.uk) if you have other dietary requirements. Halal meals are

                         St Andrew’s Street    www.emma.cam.ac.uk

available on Wednesdays and Saturdays during term time.

Food allergies

Students who are allergic to particular food ingredients, shoulddiscuss the matter with the Head Chef as

soon as possible after coming to College. The Head Chef will be able to advise on the ingredients in

particular dishes.

The College kitchens collect information from suppliers as to the ingredients in products and seeks to

avoid the unnecessary use of nuts and nut products. However, the possibility of cross contamination,

either during preparation or serving, cannot be ruled out. The elimination of all potential allergens is an

impracticable objective and, despite the precautions that are taken, there is an element of risk and if in

doubt, particular items or dishes must be avoid. The Head Chef will be able to discuss particular

requirements further.

If you are allergic to a particular ingredient the responsibility for your health rests with you. The British

Allergy Association advises that: “Adults, you are responsible for your allergy, you know what you are

allergic to and canmakeinformeddecisionsaboutwhatconstitutesareasonablelevelofriskwhenyou

chooseaprocessedfoodoreatout. Alwayscarryyourauto-injector(s). Ifyouhaveto useyouradrenaline

injection, then you must go to hospital for observation. If you do have a reaction in a public place, you must

inject yourself first and delegate someone to call an ambulance.”

Room bookings

The College has a range of rooms which can be booked for supervisions, society events and private

dining. Rooms needed for such events must be booked using the online enquiry form on the College

website - https://www.emma.cam.ac.uk/conferences/booking/form/

Once the room booking has been confirmed arrangements for catering must be made promptly with the

Head of Catering. All food and drinks consumed in rooms and outdoor spaces must be purchased from

the College. Catering arrangements must be finalised at least 10 working days before the event.

Charging for meals

Postgraduates who live in College accommodation on the main College site pay a room rent, inclusive of

the same contribution to the fixed costs of operating the College kitchens (CFC), as do undergraduates,

and are entitled to take meals at a reduced cost during NPR. The rent charged to postgraduates who live

in College accommodation off the main College includes a reduced contribution towards the fixed costs

of operating the College, and those postgraduates are entitled to meals during NPR at a reduced cost, in

the same way as undergraduates. Postgraduates who do not live in College accommodation, and

postgraduates living in couple accommodation do not pay any contribution to the fixed costs of operating

the College kitchens and must therefore pay the full price for any meals taken. Postgraduates in this

category may, if they wish, elect to pay a contribution towards fixed costs, and then pay the reduced price

for any meals taken.

Payment for meals

Your university card must be presented to the cashier whenever you purchase meals from the Cafeteria,

or goods from the Buttery Shop. The till will read your account number from the card, and the cost of your

purchases will then be transferred to your College account. The cost of any Formal Hall meals will be

transferred to your College account in the same way. When your College bill is issued each Term (see

General Information para. 19 above), a weekly summary will be shown of all your spending in the College

kitchens and on Formal Hall.

Important – please note the following points carefully:

•  Cash will not be accepted for the purchase of meals.

•  Please ensure that you have your card ready before you join the queue.

Each time you make a purchase from one of the tills in the kitchens, the total amount  that      you            have

charged to your catering account so far that term will show on the till display.

                                            19

The kitchens will be closed:

•  After lunch on 22 December, and re-open for dinner on 5 January

•  After lunch on 11 April, and re-open for dinner on 22 April

•  After lunch on 16 August, and re-open for dinner on 3 September

Buttery Shop

The Buttery Shop is located by the tills in the Cafeteria, open Monday-Friday 11.00-13.30 & 17.30-19.00. It

sells wine, beer and mineral water, milk, bread and confectionery. Items can also be purchased using your

university card or debit/credit card payment. A list of the items stocked, with prices, is on display outside

the shop. In addition, there is a vending machine for soft drinks and one for confectionery nearby.

Foreword by the Postgraduate Tutor

This Induction Programme will welcome you to Emma and aims to

make you feel at home as quickly as possible. As you will gather, there

are many people here who are happy to help you if anything is unclear

or if you have diﬃculties. If you have a question or a problem, then do

ask!

We do our best to put you at your ease in your ﬁrst few days as a

postgraduate student, but please remember that your course will start

quite quickly and will start making demands on you almost

immediately. It is important not to be taken by surprise by this and to

get into appropriate habits of work right from the start. Don’t be

surprised, either, if the pattern of your work as a postgraduate student

is diﬀerent from what you have been familiar with in the past.

I wish you well with your course and hope you have a fulﬁlling time

here both academically and socially!

Some of the activities in the programme are compulsory or highly

advisable – they are shaded in pink. Other activities are more

optional.

Events organised by the Middle Combination Room Committee

(MCR) or Emmanuel College Student’s Union (ECSU) are not shaded.

RAVEN

• When will I receive my Raven and log-in details?

   The University should be in contact by the end of August with all the details. You can also search here:

   Get your Cambridge login (Raven), email and software | IT Help and Support for more information.

FINANCE

• Do I have to pay the First Payment if I am a part-time student?

   Yes, ALL students must pay the First Payment. Part-time and Harvard students pay the reduced rate

   as well as students in college flats.

•  I paid the First Payment on the first year of my course. I am on a different course now, do I need

   to pay the First Payment again?

   You should have received a final bill with the First Payment as a credit after course completion– you

   need to pay new 100% payment of the First Payment if you are in college accommodation and reduced

   payment if you live outside of college.

•  Who do I put as Guarantor on the ‘Form of Guarantee’ if I am:

      Self-funded – parent, relative or yourself

      Funded by a funding body – if you have a sponsor please use your name as Guarantor - you are

       confirming that you have secured the funds. Please send an offer letter to student-

       billing@emma.cam.ac.uk asap - add the sponsor’s full name, address and contact details.

      Funded by Emmanuel College – as above

      EMBA/MBA student – you don’t need to fill in a guarantor, but you need to state that you are on

       EMBA/MBA course at JBS

      Harvard/Williams students – you don’t fill in this form, Harvard/Williams will do this for you.

•  What can I do if I can’t pay the First Payment on time?

      If you are self-funded

       - inform your Tutor and the Bursary immediately.

      If you are funded by the funding body

       – please send the funding letter to student-billing@emma.cam.ac.uk asap, they will respond

       in due course.

•  What the First Payment is for?

   Students` bills are paid substantially in arrears of the corresponding costs to the College (for

   example, for food, wages and so on), the First Payment evens out the fluctuations in the amount you

   owe and ensures that your final bill is small.

•  What happens to my First Payment?

                               St Andrew’s Street, Cambridge CB2 3AP

                                          www.emma.cam.ac.uk
                                              2

                      The First payment appears as a credit on the last bill after the Bursary has

                      confirmation that course has been completed. If you move-out of college

                      accommodation, but your course is not completed, college now will refund 80% of

                      the First Payment with your next bill and the rest after completion of the course

                      (reduced by any outstanding payments). As the First Payment is calculated as the

                      likely average termly bill, this means that your final bill will be small. Any credit

                      balance remaining will be refunded. If the College did not make a payment to you

   in the last eight months, you`ll need to resubmit your personal bank account details to student-

   billing@emma.cam.ac.uk. In any case you must submit online Exeat.

•  I live in non-college accommodation, but I would like a college room?

   Email tutorial-office@emma.cam.ac.uk to check if any room is available. Before arrival you must

   uplift the First Payment of 80% to the quote for those living in college. Email student-

   billing@emma.cam.ac.uk to find out how much that would be.

•  How can I get a bank letter?

   Bank letters and other verification letters are prepared by the Tutorial Office. The letter will be available

   after you have completed your College ID checks. Please submit the online form Bank Letter or

   Verification Documents. Please note, requests are processed in 2-3 working days, and longer during

   busier periods.

•  How much do I pay?

   TheCollege operatesacohort rent scheme, whereby the rent for agrade 5room for each incoming

   year is fixed so that it is as close as possible to the average room rent across all the colleges in

   the year you start your course. The rents for other grades are then calculated in relation to that.

   This rent then rises in line with the CPIH (Consumer Price Index including housing costs) in each

   subsequent year of your course. This means that most of the single rooms provided by the College

   are at rents at or below the average. It also means that there will be different scales of charges

   depending on which year you started your course. The rent includes heating and electricity,

   insurance, and internet access. To the basic rent is added the Contribution to Fixed Costs (the

   CFC). Students living on the College site pay the full amount of CFC and those living further

   away pay only a proportion. Students in College flats or living in non-college accommodation do not

   pay CFC.

   The rents for those starting in 2024 are:

   Grade     1         2             3        4              5            6    7                          8

   Rent per  £153.45   £165.87   £178.17      £190.48  £202.79        £215.21  £227.51        £239.82

   week*

   * These figures are those for postgraduates resident for 10 weeks each term on the main College site.

   They are thus a maximum. Students living away from the main site, who pay a reduced CFC

   (Catering Fixed Costs) will pay slightly less, and those resident through the year are only

   charged for 12 weeks in each 13-week period (see below).

•  How many weeks am I charged for?

   There are two different arrangements depending on which sort of course you are following:

     Students who are studying for a type of degree or qualification which is completed before the

      end of June (such as PGCE or non-UK MASt, LLM, 9-m on t h M Ph il and Diploma students)

      will be able to occupy their rooms from the beginning of October to the end of June. You will be

      charged for three 13-week periods. Within each of those periods, however, you will only be

      charged 12 weeks rent.

                                 St Andrew’s Street, Cambridge CB2 3AP

                                 www.emma.cam.ac.uk
                                                  3

                                 For almost all other students (including PhD, MRes, MBA, MFin, 12-

                        month MPhil, Clinical Medical students and 6th year Clinical Veterinary students)

                        the rent is paid for four 13-week periods. Within each of those periods, however,

                        you will only be charged 12 weeks rent. If you are in this category, you may occupy

                        your room from the beginning of October until a changeover day about a week

                        before the end of September each year. You will be informed of the changeover

   date  in  good  time.

   If you are in this category and you are finishing your course or you wish to move into non-

   College accommodation for the coming academic year, you may leave your room before the

   changeover date.Give at least two weeks’ notice of the date you will move outusingtheonline

   Exeat System. You will only be charged rent up to the date you return your keys, or the end of June,

   whichever is the later.

COUNCIL TAX

    Students in College accommodation – Full-time students do not pay Council Tax

    Students in non-college accommodation – as above but you need to request a Tax letter from

   Tutorial Office Verification Documents | Documents & Policies | College Life | Emmanuel College,

   Cambridge and apply for council tax exemption to Cambridge City Council.

    College Flats – Full-time students do not pay Council Tax, but people in work do. The Council will

   deal directly with you over your council tax and it is your responsibility to make the necessary

   arrangements with them. You need to go to the Council Tax office in St Andrew’s Street with a letter

   from the Tutorial Office confirming that you are a full-time postgraduate student at Emmanuel. If

   your partner is also a full-time student then neither of you will be eligible for Council Tax. If your

   partner is working, they will be eligible for Council Tax as if they were living in the flat by themselves

   (i.e. with a 25% reduction). Failure to do this will mean that you are charged at the full rate, and

   failure to pay a council tax bill will result in legal action being taken against you by the council.

   More      information          about  council     tax        for  students        available            here:
