          During your time at Emmanuel it is likely that the College will make a payment to

          you, perhaps for a Prize, Award, or Scholarship, or a grant for travel or hardship.

          Please be advised that the College will ONLY remit to your PERSONAL UK bank

          account, please use the online bank form on the College`s website to request a bank

letter that will enable you to open a UK bank account if you don`t have one. Any unclaimed balances

within 24 months of your course finishing will be treated as a donation to the College.

Once your PERSONAL UK bank account can be provided please fill in the form and return to the

Bursary.
